    <h1>Unit 1 - Education and Humanity</h1>
    <h4>"The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet." <br>(शिक्षाको जरा तितो छ, तर फल गुलियो हुन्छ ।) <br>- Aristotle</h4>
    <h3>Now read the speech by Malala delivered at the United Nations Youth Assembly on 12 July 2013.</h3>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11eng_ch1_1.jpg">
    <p>
        Today, it is an honour for me to be speaking again after a long time. Being here with such honourable people is a great moment in my life. I don't know where to begin my speech. I don't know what people would be expecting me to say. But first of all, thank you to God for whom we are all equal and thank you to every person who has prayed for my fast recovery and a new life. I cannot believe how much love people have shown me. I have received thousands of good wish cards and gifts from all over the world. Thank you to all of them. Thank you to the children whose innocent words encouraged me. Thank you to my elders whose prayers strengthened me. I would like to thank my nurses, doctors and all of the staff of the hospitals in Pakistan and the UK and the UAE governments who have helped me get better and recover my strength. <br><br>
        I fully support Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General in his Global Education First Initiative and the work of the UN Special Envoy Mr. Gordon Brown. And I thank them both for the leadership they continue to give. They continue to inspire all of us to action. There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers, who are not only speaking for human rights, but who are struggling to achieve their goals of education, peace and equality. Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured. I am just one of them. <br><br>
        So here I stand, one girl among many. <br>
        I speak not for myself, but for all girls and boys.<br>
        I raise up my voice not so that I can shout, but<br>
        so that those without a voice can be heard.<br>
        Those who have fought for their rights:<br>
        Their right to live in peace.<br>
        Their right to be treated with dignity. <br>
        Their right to equality of opportunity.<br>
        Their right to be educated. <br><br>
        On the 9th of October 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends too. They thought that the bullets would silence us. But they failed. And then, out of that silence came, thousands of voices. The terrorists thought that they would change our aims and stop our ambitions but nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born. I am the same Malala. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same. My dreams are the same. <br><br>
        I am not against anyone. Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorists group. I am here to speak up for the right of education of every child. I want education for the sons and the daughters of all the extremists especially the Taliban. <br><br>
        I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there is a gun in my hand and he stands in front of me, I would not shoot him. This is the compassion that I have learnt from Muhammad-the prophet of mercy, Jesus Christ and Lord Buddha. This is the legacy of change that I have inherited from Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. This is the philosophy of non-violence that I have learnt from Gandhi Jee, Bacha Khan and Mother Teresa. And this is the forgiveness that I have learnt from my mother and father. This is what my soul is telling me, be peaceful and love everyone. <br><br>
        We realise the importance of light when we see darkness. We realise the importance of our voice when we are silenced. In the same way, when we were in Swat, the north of Pakistan, we realised the importance of pens and books when we saw the guns. <br><br>
        The wise saying, "The pen is mightier than sword" was true. The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them. And that is why they killed 14 innocent medical students in the recent attack in Quetta. And that is why they killed many female teachers and polio workers in Khyber Pukhtoon Khwa and FATA. That is why they are blasting schools every day. Because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring into our society. <br><br>
        I remember that there was a boy in our school who was asked by a journalist, Why are the Taliban against education?" He answered very simply. By pointing to his book he said, "A Talib doesn't know what is written inside this book." They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to the hell just because of going to school. The terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits. Pakistan is peace-loving democratic country. Pashtuns want education for their daughters and sons. And Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. Islam says that it is not only each child's right to get education, rather it is their duty and responsibility. <br><br>
        Peace is necessary for education. In many parts of the world wars and conflicts stop children to go to their schools. We are really tired of these wars. Women and children are suffering in many parts of the world in many ways. Young girls have to do domestic child labour and are forced to get married at early age. Poverty, ignorance, injustice, racism and the deprivation of basic rights are the main problems faced by both men and women. <br><br>
        Today I am focusing on women's rights and girls' education because they are suffering the most. There was a time when women social activists asked men to stand up for their rights. But, this time, we will do it by ourselves. I am not telling men to step away from speaking for women's rights rather I am focusing on women to be independent to fight for themselves.
        Now it's time to speak up. <br><br>
        So today, we call upon the world leaders to change their strategic policies in favour of peace and prosperity. <br><br>
        We call upon the world leaders that all the peace deals must protect women and children's rights. A deal that goes against the dignity of women and their rights is unacceptable. <br><br>
        We call upon all governments to ensure free compulsory education for every child all over the world.<br><br>
        We call upon all governments to fight against terrorism and violence, to protect children from brutality and harm.<br><br>
        We call upon the developed nations to support the expansion of educational opportunities for girls in the developing world.<br><br>
        We call upon all communities to be tolerant to reject prejudice based on cust, creed, sect, religion or gender. To ensure freedom and equality for women so that they can flourish, we cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. <br><br>
        We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave to embrace the strength within themselves and realise their full potential.<br><br>
        We want schools and education for every child's bright future. We will continue our journey to our destination of peace and education for everyone. No one can stop us: We will speak for our rights and we will bring change through our voice. We must believe in the power and the strength of our words. Our words can change the world.<br><br>
        Because we are all together, united for the cause of education. And if we want to achieve our goal, then let us empower ourselves with the weapon of knowledge and let us shield ourselves with unity and togetherness. <br><br>
        We must not forget that millions of people are suffering from poverty, injustice and ignorance. We must not forget that millions of children are out of schools. We must not forget that our sisters and brothers are waiting for a bright peaceful future.<br><br>
        So let us wage a global struggle against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism and let us pick up our books and pens. They are our most powerful weapons.<br><br>
        One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world.<br><br>
        Education is the only solution. Education first.

        <strong>Ans. </strong>The main message of this speech is to unite the whole world to educate all the girl children so as to educate the whole world.<br><br>
    </p><br><br>
    <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child? Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend school. </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>All children have the right to quality education. Education combined with knowledge and skills can enable them to fulfil all the common necessities of daily life. However, the right to education is not available to all children. Millions of children are still reported to have been deprived of this fundamental right. For such deprivation, poverty, superstition, discriminative gender based socio-cultural traditions among others are found to be the major causes.<br><br>For ensuring the right to basic and quality education to all government, civil society, parents, political unions and leaders, children, and all the responsible individuals and institutions have to put in their combined efforts to fight against superstition, discriminations, poverty including any other hindrance ahead in the path. <br><br>
        <strong>b.	Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest to overcome such discrimination against girls?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The reports published from government and non-government agencies every year clearly indicate the issues of discriminations between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country. This trend is more common in the rural areas compared to the urban areas.<br><br>There are several factors responsible for such discrimination such as poverty, superstition, discriminative gender based socio-cultural traditions with far wider preference and privileges to the sons. <br><br>Eliminating the ill practice of preferring sons to the daughters is a must as the primary step in the line of eliminating discrimination between the sons and the daughters. For this, wider and effective awareness campaign should be conducted to urge the people to stop discrimination right from their homes and families. Implementing harsh rules against the discriminatory practices can be another important way to put an end to the gender inequality prevalent in any part of the world. <br><br>
        <strong>c.	A Chinese philosopher Confucius said, "If your plan is for one year, plant rice: if your plan is for ten years, plant trees; if your plan is for one hundred years, educate children." What is the meaning of this saying? Elaborate this with examples.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>This saying by Confucius is very popular among people who understand the importance of education. Education enlightens the individuals by removing the darkness in the form of ignorance and superstition. According to this saying, education has long-term benefits rather than immediate returns. If we start educating the young children from now on, it will take several years to complete their schooling process, and even decades to harvest the fruits of name, fame and prosperity. So if we compare education with farming, it is the kind of farming which takes many years to harvest the production. Yet, once the harvest begins, it doesn't stop harvesting even after death unlike the seasonal farming for immediate returns.<br><br>

    <h1>Unit 2 - Communication</h1>
    <h4>"Good writing does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else’s head" <br> (राम्रो लेखनले अरुलाई मनाउदैमा सफल र असफल हुँदैन । यसले कसरी तपाईलाई संलग्न गराउँछ, सोच्न लगाउछ र अरूको दिमागमा के कुरा छ भन्ने कुरा बुझन लगाउछ भन्ने कुराले सफल र असफल मानिन्छ ।) <br>-Malcolm Gladwell </h4>
    <h3>Now read the following essay about freewriting as another way to brainstorm a general topic in order to arrive at a specific focus in writing.</h3>
    <p>
        The most effective way I know to improve your writing is to do freewriting exercises regularly. At least three times a week. They are sometimes called "automatic writing." "babbling," or "jabbering" exercises. The idea is simply to write for minutes (later on, perhaps fifteen twenty). Don't stop for anything Go quickly without rushing. Never stop to look back, to cross something out, to wonder how to spell something, to wonder what word or thought to use, or to think about what you are doing. If you can't think of a word or a spelling, just use a squiggle or else write, "I can't think of it." Just put down something. The easiest thing is just to put down whatever is in your mind. If you get stuck it's fine to write "I can't think what to say, I can't think what to say" as many times as you want; or repeat the last word you wrote over and over again; or anything else. The only requirement is that you never stop.
    </p>

    <p>
        Freewriting exercise is important. It must be a piece of writing which, even if someone reads it, doesn't send any ripples back to you. It is like writing something and putting it in a bottle in the sea. The teacher less class helps your writing by providing maximum feedback. Freewriting helps you by providing no feedback at all. When I assign one, I invite the writer to let me read it. But also tell him to keep it if he prefers. I read it quickly and make no comments at all and I do not speak with him about it. The main thing is that a freewriting must never be evaluated in any way; in fact, there must be no discussion or comment at all. <br><br>
        Here is an example of a fairly coherent exercise (sometimes they are very incoherent, which is fine): <br>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>I think I'll write what's on my mind, but the only thing on my mind right now is what to write for ten minutes. I've never done this before and I'm not prepared in any way-the sky is cloudy today, how's that? Now I'm afraid I won't be able to think of what to write when I get to the end of the sentence-well, here I am at the end of the sentence-here I am again, again, again, again, at least I'm still writing-Now I ask is there some reason to be happy that I'm still writing-ah yes! Here comes the question again-What am I getting out of this? What point is there in it? It's almost obscene to always ask it but I seem to question everything that way and I was going to say something else pertaining to that but I got so busy writing down the first part that I forgot what I was leading into. This is kind of fun oh don't stop writing-cars and trucks speeding by somewhere out the window, pens clittering across peoples' papers. The sky is still cloudy-is it symbolic that I should be mentioning it? Huh? I don’t know. Maybe I should try colours, blue, red, dirty words-wait a minute-no can't do that, orange, yellow, arm tired, green pink violet magenta lavender red brown black green-now that I can't think of any more colours-just about done-relief? Maybe.</td>

    <p>
        Freewriting may seem crazy but actually it makes simple sense. Think of the difference between speaking and writing. Writing has the advantage of permitting more editing. But that's its downfall too, Almost everybody interposes a massive and complicated series of editing between the time words start to be born into consciousness and when they finally. come off the end of the pencil or typewriter onto the page. This is partly because schooling makes us obsessed with the "mistakes" we make in writing. Many people are constantly thinking about spelling and grammar as they try to write. I am always thinking about the awkwardness, wordiness, and general mushiness of my natural verbal product as I try to write down words. <br><br>
        But it's not just "mistakes" or "bad writing" we edit as we write. We also edit unacceptable thoughts and feelings, as we do in speaking. In writing there is more time to do it so the editing is heavier: when speaking, there's someone right there waiting for a reply and he'll get bored or think we're crazy if we don't come out with something. Most of the time in speaking, we settle for the catch-as-catch-can way in which the words tumble out. In writing, however, there's a chance to try to get them right. But the opportunity to get them right is a terrible burden: you can work for two hours trying to get a paragraph "right" and discover it's not right at all. And then give up.
        Editing, in itself, is not the problem. Editing is usually necessary if we want to end up with something satisfactory. The problem is that editing goes on at the same time as producing. The editor is, as it were, constantly looking over the shoulder of the producer and constantly fiddling with what he's doing while he's in the middle of trying to do it. No wonder the producer gets nervous, jumpy, inhibited, and finally can't be coherent. It's an unnecessary burden to try to think of words and also worry at the same time whether they're the right words. <br><br>
        The main thing about freewriting is that it is none-editing. It is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and putting them down on the page. Practiced regularly, it undoes the ingrained habit of editing at the same time you are trying to produce. It will make writing less blocked because words will come more easily. You will use up more paper, but chew up fewer pencils. Next time you write; notice how often you stop yourself from writing down something.<br><br>
        you were going to write down. Or else cross it out after it's written, "Naturally," you say, "it wasn't any good." But think for a moment about the occasions when you spoke well. Seldom was it because you first got the beginning just right. Usually it was a matter of a halting or even garbled beginning, but you kept going and your speech finally became coherent and even powerful. There is a lesson here for writing: trying to get the beginning just right is a formula for failure and probably a secret tactic to make yourself give up writing. Make some words, whatever they are, and then grab hold of that line and reel in as hard as you can. Afterwards you can throw away lousy beginnings and make new ones. This is the quickest way to get into good writing. <br><br>
        The habit of compulsive, premature editing doesn't just make writing hard. It also makes writing dead. Your voice is damped out by all the interruptions, changes, and hesitations between the consciousness and the page. In your natural way of producing words there is a sound, a texture, a rhythm - a voice which is the main source of power in your writing I don't know how it works, but this voice is the force that will make a reader listen to you, the energy that drives the meanings through his thick skull. Maybe you don't like your voice, maybe people have made fun of it. But it's the only voice you've got. It's your only source of power. You better get back into it, no matter what you think of it. If you keep writing in it, it may change into something you like better. But if you abandon it, you'll likely never have a voice and never be heard.<br><br>
        Free writings are vacuums. Gradually you will begin to carry over into your regular writing some of the voice, force, and connectedness that creep into those vacuums.<br>

    <h1>Unit 3 - Media and Society</h1>
    <h4>"The death of a billionaire is worth more to the media than the lives of a billion poor people." <br> (एक अरबपतिको मृत्यु एक अर्ब गरीब व्यक्तिका] जीवनभन्दा मिडियालाई बढी मूल्यवान छ। <br>-  Mokokoma Mokhonoana </h4>
    <h3>Read the following blog about how social media influence and control people' s lives causing them to get distracted in the society.</h3>
    <p>
        What comes to your mind when you hear the term "Social Media'? Perhaps, some people think the social as the media that makes them able to meet and communicate with people around the world. While some others think that, it is the channel that gives them the chance to send and receive information. Others might see it as the tool to get many updates from people who we follow and a part of a new marketing strategy. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Nowadays, social media seems like a big part of our life. When you have no reply to your text from you friend, you can greet them on Facebook. When you want to listen to music or watch a music video from your favourite singer you can go to YouTube. When you just wake up and open your eyes, you don't have to walk outside to get the newspaper, just take your phone and scroll your Twitter timeline then you'll get the information. Blog and Forum are also types of social media because they allow you to share "what you think" about articles, pictures, videos and so on. Social media not only allows the users to share about their profession, major of study, works and company, addresses, political views and religion, but also allows them to find a job and to find the employees required. In fact, everything looks and feels easier to do with social media. <br>
        But from the examples above, I have a question in my mind. "If everything looks and feels easier to do with social media, isn't something strange? Isn't society extremely dependent on social media? How strongly can social media influence and control people's lives?" This question leads me to recall a very interesting case in Indonesia that happened about some years ago.

    <p>
        In August 2008, there was a woman who was known by Indonesian people as Prita Mulyasari. Her case began when she wrote about her disappointment about the services of a Hospital in Jakarta. She wrote everything about the hospital and the bad services that she got from the doctors, nurses and administration staff. Then she sent a message to her friends on the mailing list. Actually, she just tried to remind her friends to be more selective in choosing the hospital and to be more careful in accepting many kinds of services. But, her message became a big problem after her friend shared it to a website (The People's Forum) which so many read and commented about the issue. <br><br>
        In September 2008, the management of the hospital reported Prita Mulyasari for the bad news she has spread about the hospital. The management of the hospital claimed for material loss of about Rp.161 million as a replacement for clarification in national newspapers and Rp.100 million for immaterial losses. She wasn't only to pay for the hospital losses but she was also detained in May 2009. After 8 months she went through the inspection and verification process and was convicted by the court for violating the law about using the ICT (Information and Communication Technology). This case got rapidly spread among Indonesian people. As common issues, there are always pros and cons. Although the Indonesian people didn't justify what Prita had done against the hospital, most of them really cared about her life and her condition and tried to help her, at least to pay the amercement.<br><br>
        The first Facebook account which was made by some people is (https://www.facebook. com/KoinPeduliPrita). They were spreading "Bantu Bebaskan Prita" or "Help Free Prita". among Indonesian People and approached them to help Prita by collecting the coins. It didn't take a long time. Many volunteers, social workers, activists, students and even artists came together to help her. They were collecting many coins from people on the street, office, and even an entertainment centre. Some singers also held a charity concert to help her. In December 2009, the campaign was concluded and they succeeded in collecting the coins to help Prita, about Rp. 825 million. The money was extremely worth it for Prita, although she still had to go through the period of detainees. However, the money was very helpful for her not only to pay the amercement but also for her life, considering she had two kids to bring up.<br><br>
        I'm not trying to spread bad news about my country or discredit someone or some institutions, I am just trying to make you believe that social media has the strength to influence and control people's lives. Prita's case clearly explains to us that social media were able to make people's life get worse or get better. It certainly does not mean that we need to stay away or become anti-social media. People are stronger than social media because we can easily think before we act and think before we speak. There is nothing to be worried about if we are wise when we share something on social media.<br><br>

        <strong>Ans. </strong>	Social media have positive impacts in the society. The platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Viber, etc have assisted us to connect ourselves to family members, friends and relatives who may be living in different corners of the world. Those social networking sites support people to share pictures and videos, and communicate with the people of their choice. This makes our relationships stronger and brings families together in a way that was impossible in the past.

It is interesting to mention that the person who involves in business can be benefited from social media, too, Online promotions are less expensive than consistent ads on TV channels and newspapers. On the other hand, they give chance to reach the wider audience and find active customers across the world.

        <br><br> In virtual communication a recipient doesn't need to be present. It lets us talk to people no matter what location they are in. It is more likely to be non-verbal. Using virtual communication helps us to keep in touch with people even if they are busy and not able to meet up. Various social network sites and apps are common platforms to have virtual communication. It's easier to organize and share all of the information we want when we communicate virtually.
        <br><br> Face to face communication needs both the sender and recipient to be present & respond immediately. When we talk to somebody face-to-face we can actively. notice their level of attention in our conversation. It helps us to build personal relationship and socialize. It prevents our communicative skills to be rusty, with our body language and tone. We can express what we want. Message can be easily understood by the concerned parties as both verbal and non-verbal ways. In-face-to face communication illiterate people also understand message that they don't. understand in written message. Conversation on the telephone or cell phone and chatting through internet are oral communication but cannot be termed as face to face communication. Body language, facial expression, gesture and eye contact also are very effective to convey messages.

    <h3>b.	What is cyber bullying? What are its effects? How can it be stopped?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Cyber bullying is the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. It can cause significant emotional and psychological distress, just like any other victim of bullying. Cyber bullied kids may experience anxiety, fear, depression, and low self-esteem. They also may experience physical symptoms, and struggle academically. It changes the victim's mood, if a lot of kids are participating in a bullying. It can feel at times like the entire world knows what is going on around. Sometimes the stress of dealing with it can go beyond one's handling capacity. They feel vulnerable or powerless. The no longer have a place from where they can escape. This can escalate feeling of fear. Feelings of worthlessness; vengefulness, disinterests are some other issues related to cyber bullying. <br><br>
        The victims of Cyber Bullying may respond to these feelings by harming themselves. They might get angry about themselves. The victims may lose their interest in things they once enjoyed and spend less time interacting with family and friends. And, in some cases depression and thoughts of suicide may surface. <br><br>
        If the victims cannot dismiss their feelings, this may lead to some disastrous consequences. So, it is very important to communicate the incidents of such crimes to the family or friends, and to the nearby civil security forces. It's equally dangerous to tolerate such sinful acts no matter who is involved. Learning to use the virtual platform of communication without causing any harm to the self and others is probably the best way to prevent this new form of crime in the path of human civilization. <br><br>

<p>The Qin Dynasty has a short duration (221 206 BCE), but very important in Chinese history. It followed the Zhou Dynasty (1046 256 BCE) and it ended when Liu Bang became the king of Han in 206 BCE (the formal beginning of the Han Dynasty). Despite its brevity, the Qin Dynasty left important marks on Chinese culture. In fact, the name "China" is derived from the name Qin ("Ch' in" in former Romanisation systems). Following the Zhou Dynasty, China became involved in a seemingly endless conflict between the various regions for supreme control of the country. This period of conflict has come to be known as The Warring States Period (426-221 BCE). A series of victories by the state of Qin towards the end of the Warring States Period resulted in their complete conquest of China in 221 BCE when the Qin Empire unified China for the first time in its history.</p>

<strong>Origins of the Qin Kingdom</strong>
<p>During the Zhou Dynasty, China was never a unified kingdom. The Zhou government bore a strong resemblance to some of the forms of feudalism in medieval Europe, which is why the Zhou age is sometimes referred to as a feudal age. China was composed of a network of city-states loyal to the Zhou king, from which military and political control spread over the surrounding farming villages.</p>

<p>About 771 BCE, a barbarian invasion drove the Zhou rulers eastwards. During this time, the state of Qin became responsible for guarding the western frontier and they gradually moved eastward and eventually occupied the original Zhou domains. Thus, the Qin became a close ally of the Zhou and they also had marriage relations with the Zhou ruling class. King Ping of Zhou (770-720 BCE) transferred titles of the nobility and huge estates to the chief of Qin. Many Chinese historians consider this event as pivotal for the state of Qin. The Qin was, at that time, very awa of the fact that they could be a great power. The elevation to nobility of the Qin meant that the Qin could become more ambitious and better fend off attacks from surrounding regions. As a consequence, these centuries spent fighting non-Chinese tribes helped the Qin gain invaluable experience in warfare and territorial expansion.</p>

<p>Of the many Chinese states, the Qin had the advantage of a favourable location: Its territory in modern Shaanxi Province is well guarded from the east by mountains and gorges and has easy access to the North China plain through the Yellow River passes. No major battle ever took place in the Qin's heartland.</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, all the states in China were trying to draw more power and prestige to themselves. The states of Qin and Chu were the strongest which was due, in part, to the locations of these two states being able to command vast resources. They were also able to expand their borders without fear of immediate conflict, unlike the other states, and so could obtain still further resources. This benefit, and others such as the size of the Qin army and their expert use of the chariot, contributed to their success in warfare. The Qin had all of the resources and advantages but what finally gave them victory over the other states was their ruthlessness in battle. The Qin statesman Shang Yang (356 (356) 338 BCE) advocated total war and a disregard for the polite policies of battle which the Chinese Generals had always adhered to. His lessons were implemented by Ying Zheng, King of the Qin, who emerged victorious from the Warring States Period and proclaimed himself Shi Huangdi - first emperor of China in 221 BCE. About 230 BCE, when the final campaign to unify China began, it is estimated that the Qin controlled one-third of all the land under cultivation in China and one-third of China's total population.</p>

<strong>Achievements in the Qin Dynasty</strong>
<p>Early in the Qin Empire, the practice of Legalism reached its peak in Chinese history. This idea of state policy was devised by Shang Yang who came to Qin as a foreign advisor Qin was lacking, early on, in skilled intellectuals and politicians and, therefore, had to look beyond its borders for talented people. Shang Yang was one of those foreign talented persons and he would have a lasting influence on the Qin Empire. During his time as a minister, Shang Yang radically renovated the policies of government but, in fact, he simply revived a practice which was already present for years: a form of government with a focus on greater efficiency and less adherence to tradition in which strict adherence to the letter of the law was made paramount. Emperor Shi Huangdi approved of Shang Yang's policies and implemented them across his realm.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter4img2.jpg">
<p>This form of government consisted of a collectivisation programme and the decimation of aristocratic power. Farmers were freed from serfdom and Shi Huangdi reduced the power of the aristocracy. The people throughout the empire were now supposed to bear collective responsibility for each other. If a person did not behave according to the rules, then others were required to report to him. If they did not do this, they were quartered or beheaded. Fear and control were the key features of this political system. In addition, one's personal importance to the empire was also a key element. If you, as a person, meant nothing to the state, you actually meant nothing objectively; your life was meaningless. Those who contributed the most to the state were highly rewarded while those whose lives were considered of no consequence were sent to work as slaves on Shi Huangdi's building projects such as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal, and the roads which increased ease of trade and travel.</p>

<p>Another result of the Legalism of Shi Huangdi was that scholarship was strongly suppressed and literacy denied to the majority of the populace. Shi Huangdi believed that uneducated people were easier to control and so the people should remain stupid so that they would never think to doubt who was in charge of the empire. This policy resulted in the burning of books on a large scale and, in 212 BCE, on the advice of his chief advisor Li Siu, Shi Huangdi had scholars executed on a large scale. Books were banned throughout the empire, as was teaching, except for subjects touching upon the re-written history of the Qin Dynasty, Legalism, or the personal glory of Shi Huangdi. It was not until the later Han Dynasty that books were recovered from hiding and repaired, and literacy was again available to the people of China.</p>

<p>Although Shi Huangdi and Shang Yang's Legalism (as well as Li Siu's policies) were hated by many at the time (and have been generally frowned upon by scholars of the period), later the Qin kings and emperors of China were well aware of the strong impact that Legalism had on the efficiency and strength of the state. Legalism helped to create a superior army, a disciplined bureaucracy, an obedient populace, and the unquestioned authority of a strong central government. This bureaucratic model became the standard for the Chinese government and is still maintained in some form today. Although Confucianism was preferred in later dynasties, Legalism continued to exert a strong influence in China. It was often the case that the harsh Legalism was glossed over with just a different name and, quite often, as 'Confucianism'.</p>

<strong>The End of the Qin Empire</strong>
<p>In the year 210 BCE emperor Shi Huangdi died on a journey through the realm. The people were told that these trips were designed for the inspection of the empire but later evidence suggests that the emperor was looking for an elixir of immortality. In his later years, Shi Huangdi became obsessed with death and the hope of eternal life. In constant fear of assassination, it is said, he never slept in the same room of his palace two nights consecutively and he ordered the construction of his elaborate tomb (including his Terracotta Army of 8,000 warriors) early on in his reign. The cause of his death is still unknown. Li Siu (c..280-208 BCE), the then prime minister of the recently deceased emperor, tried to hide the fact that Shi Huangdi was deceased in any possible way. He brought the emperor's body back to the capital along with carts of dead fish to mask the smell of the corpse. Along with Zhao Gao (died 208/207 BCE). Li Siu contrived to place Hu Hai on the throne. Hu Hai was the weak second son of Shi Huangdi. Due to the weakness of Hu Hai, the oppressed people of China grew bolder and soon began to revolt. </p>
<p>Through a series of uprisings and rebel alliances, the Qin authority was overthrown in the year 206 BCE in the capital of Xianyang. The Imperial House was massacred and the Qin Dynasty was thus at an end. A complicated series of battles followed for the honour of being the successor to the Qin Dynasty which resulted in the period known as the Chu Han Contention in which Xiang-Yu of the state of Chu fought Liu Bang of Han for supremacy. Liu Bang emerged victorious following Xiang-Yu's defeat at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BCE. Liu Bang (247 BCE- 195 BCE) was applauded as a man of the people and, after his victory, founded the Han Dynasty.</p>
<strong>Legacy of the Qin Dynasty</strong>
<p>As mentioned previously, Legalism had a lasting effect on the entirety of Chinese history. The Qin Dynasty created the standard of bureaucratic government and the Legalistic policies first initiated by the Qin are still seen in China today. In addition, the dynasty left a wonder of ancient artwork: The Terracotta Army Xi'an. This tomb reflects the in character of the Chinese emperor and his unending desire. to be immortal. The Terracotta Army also exemplifies what Chinese society at that time was able to produce once it had been formed as a state. The most famous legacy left by the Qin is The Great Wall of China. Although the present structure does not date from the Qin Dynasty, it was begun under Shi Huangdi, as was the Grand Canal, and the roads which today link the cities of China and the countryside. The Qin did more than just found a dynasty in China: they brought a continent together.</p>

<h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
<h3>a.	The Great wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or against this statement.</h3>
<p>Ans. In an autocracy power remains in the hands of a single person. The autocratic political system has the feature of fear and control. Absolute monarch and military dictators are the examples of autocracy. The great advantage to autocracy is that when immediate and certain action is necessary, serious decisions are quickly made and brought into action. Autocratic leaders usually make choices which rely on their ideas and judgements and hardly accept any advice from others from outside their own small circle.</p>
<P>The rulers are able to collect resources. Whatever seems important they order people to fulfil the vision. The autocrats have the army force as their sole power. They keep eyes on their people as well as protect from any invading neighbours. They establish rules themselves. Projecting any protest or objection on their vision  is a risky endeavour. Some of the great structures such as the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall have been the fancy of autocrats in the name of being immortal.</P>
<p>Commemorating a victory in battle, dedication to their loved ones, gaining popularity and employing unskilled and semiskilled labours, slavery system along with talented artisans, architects, the autocratic rulers created such wonders. </p>

<h3>b.	How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism? </h3>
<p>Ans.	Feudalism is a social system prevailed in Europe during middle age in which  people (Vasslas were given land and protection by a noble man (lord) and had to work and fight for him in return. </p>

ii.	The landlord couldn't deprive the vassals of their land and had to care for them during disability.<br>
iii.	It helped to develop the qualities like loyalty, bravery, generosity, humility and courtesy.<br>
iv.	The vassals showed courteousness, loyalty, and humility to the lords, and in return the lords revealed love & bigheartedness to the vassals. <br>
v.	Feudalism established social & moral trends<br>
vi.	Feudal system showed the way for the rise of states in modern times.<br>
vii. Strong kingdom established.<br>
<strong>Cons of feudalism</strong><br>
<br>
i.	Feudalism brought class division in the society<br>

<p>The Looking Glass</p>

<h2>Before you read</h2>
<h3>
    a.	What do you think a looking glass is? 
    </h3>
<p>Ans. Looking glass is the imagery of reflection of life. It reflects the image of our body. and psychological impact related to our dream world</p>
<h3>b.	Do you dream while you are asleep? Do dreams have meaning in real life?</h3>
<p>Ans. Yes, because some unfulfilled desires are in play while dreaming. If we don't get things that we want in real life, those things will surface in our dream. It is only a feeling of our heart, it is illusion of life.</p>

<h3>c.	Do you believe in imagination or reality? Why?</h3>
<p>Ans. Sometimes imagination comes into reality as bliss. Imagination ignites passion. Our imagination and thoughts drive us ahead to shape our future. Imagination is every thing: it is preview for life's coming attraction, it is stimulation for creativity and innovation, and it is all magical despite having the harsher reality in one's life.</p>
<h3>Now read the following story about the dream of a young girl with the harsh realities in her life.</h3>
<p>New Year's Eve. Nellie, the daughter of a landowner and general, a young and pretty girl, dreaming day and night of being married, was sitting in her room, gazing with exhausted, half-closed eyes into the looking-glass. She was pale, tense, and as motionless as the looking- glass.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter5img1.jpg">

<p>The non-existent but apparent vista of a long, narrow corridor with endless rows of candles, the reflection of her face, her hands, of the frame all this was already clouded in mist and merged into a boundless grey sea. The sea was undulating, gleaming and now and then. flaring crimson.</p>

<p>Looking at Nellie's motionless eyes and parted lips, one could hardly say whether she was asleep or awake, but nevertheless she was seeing. At first, she saw only the smile and soft, charming expression of someone's eyes, then against the shifting grey background there gradually appeared the outlines of a head, a face, eyebrows, beard. It was he, the destined one, the object of long dreams and hopes. The destined one was for Nellie everything, the significance of life, personal happiness, career, fate. Outside him, as on the grey background of the looking-glass, all was dark, empty, meaningless. And so it was not strange that, seeing before her a handsome, gently smiling face, she was conscious of bliss, of an unutterably sweet dream that could not be expressed in speech or on paper. Then she heard his voice, saw herself living under the same roof with him, her life merged into his Months and years flew by against the grey background. And Nellie saw her future distinctly in all its details.</p>

<P>Picture followed picture against the grey background. Now Nellie saw herself one winter night knocking at the door of Stepan Lukitch, the district doctor. The old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate. The doctor's windows were in darkness. All was silence.</P>

<P>"For God's sake, for God's sake!" whispered Nellie. But at last the garden gate creaked and Nellie saw the doctor's cook. "Is the doctor at home?" </P>

<P>"His honour's asleep," whispered the cook into her sleeve, as though afraid of waking her master. "He's only just got home from his fever patients, and gave orders he was not to be woken."</P>

<p>But Nellie scarcely heard the cook. Thrusting her aside, she rushed headlong into the doctor's house. Running through some dark and stuffy rooms, upsetting two or three chairs, she at last reached the doctor's bedroom. Stepan Lukitch was lying on his bed, dressed, but without his coat, and with pouting lips was breathing into his open hand. A little night-light glimmered faintly beside him. Without uttering a word Nellie sat down and began to cry. She wept bitterly, shaking all over.</p>

<p>"My husband is ill!" she sobbed out. Stepan Lukitch was silent. He slowly sat up. propped his head on his hand, and looked at his visitor with fixed, sleepy eyes. "My husband is ill!" Nellie continued, restraining her sobs. "For mercy's sake come quickly. Make haste... Make haste!"</p>

<p>"Eh?" growled the doctor, blowing into his hand. "Come! Come this very minute! Or... it's terrible to think! For mercy's sake!"</p>

<p>And pale, exhausted Nellie, gasping and swallowing her tears, began describing to the doctor her husband's illness, her unutterable terror. Her sufferings would have touched the heart of a stone, but the doctor looked at her, blew into his open hand, and not a movement.</p>

<p>"I'll come to-morrow!" he muttered. "That's impossible!" cried Nellie. "I know my husband has typhus! At once... this very minute you are needed!"</p>
<p>"I... er... have only just come in," muttered the doctor. "For the last three days I've been away, seeing typhus patients, and I'm exhausted and ill myself.... I simply can't! Absolutely! I've caught it myself! There!" </p>

<p>And the doctor thrust before her eyes a clinical thermometer. "My temperature is nearly forty... I absolutely can't. I can scarcely sit up. Excuse me. I'll lie down...." The doctor lay down.</p>

<p>"But I implore you, doctor," Nellie moaned in despair. "I beseech you! Help me, for mercy's sake! Make a great effort and come! I will repay you, doctor!" "Oh, dear!... Why, I have told you already. Ah!" </p>

<p>Nellie leapt up and walked nervously up and down the bedroom. She longed to explain to the doctor, to bring him to reason.... She thought if only he knew how dear her husband was to her and how unhappy she was, he would forget his exhaustion and his illness. But how could she be eloquent enough?</p>


<p>"Go to the Zemstvo doctor," she heard Stepan Lukitch's voice.</p>

<p>"That's impossible! He lives more than twenty miles from here, and time is precious. And the horses can't stand it. It is thirty miles from us to you, and as much from here to the Zemstvo doctor. No, it's impossible! Come along. Stepan Lukitch. I ask of you a heroic deed. Come, perform that heroic deed! Have pity on us!"</p>

<p>"It's beyond everything. I'm in a fever . . . my head's in a whirl... and she won't understand! Leave me alone!"
    "But you are in duty bound to come! You cannot refuse to come! It's egoism! A man is bound to sacrifice his life for his neighbour, and you you refuse to come! I will summon you before the Court."
    </p>
<p>Nellie felt that she was uttering a false and undeserved insult, but for her husband's sake she was capable of forgetting logic, tact, sympathy for others. In reply to her threats, the doctor greedily gulped a glass of cold water. Nellie fell to entreating and imploring like the very lowest beggar. At last, the doctor gave way. He slowly got up. puffing and panting, looking for his coat.
    "Here it is!" cried Nellie, helping him. "Let me put it on to you. Come along! I will repay you. All my life I shall be grateful to you..."
    </p>
<p>But what agony! After putting on his coat, the doctor lay down again. Nellie got him up and dragged him to the hall. Then there was an agonizing to-do over his galoshes, his overcoat.... His cap was lost. But at last Nellie was in the carriage with the doctor. Now they had only to drive thirty miles and her husband would have a doctor's help. The earth was wrapped in darkness. One could not see one's hand before one's face. A cold winter wind was blowing. There were frozen lumps under their wheels.</p>

<p>The coachman was continually stopping and wondering which road to take.</p>
<P>Nellie and the doctor sat silent all the way. It was fearfully jolting, but they felt the cold nor the jolts.</P>
<p>"Get on, get on!" Nellie implored the driver.</p>
<p>At five in the morning, the exhausted horses drove into the yard. Nellie saw the familiar gates, the well with the crane, the long row of stables and barns. At last, she was at home.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. I will be back directly." she said to Stepan Lukitch, making him sit down on the sofa in the dining-room. "Sit still and wait a little, and I'll see how he is going on."</p>
<p>On her return from her husband, Nellie found the doctor lying down. He was lying on the sofa and muttering.</p>
<P>
    "Doctor, please!.. doctor!"<br>
"Eh? Ask Domna!" muttered Stepan Lukitch. "What?"<br>
"They said at the meeting... Vlassov said... Who?... what?"<br>

</P>
<p>And to her horror Nellie saw that the doctor was as delirious as her husband. What was to be done? "I must go for the Zemstvo doctor," she decided.</p>
<p>Then again there followed darkness, a cutting cold wind, lumps of frozen earth. She was suffering in body and in soul, and delusive nature has no arts, no deceptions to compensate these sufferings.</p>
<p>Then she saw against the grey background how her husband every spring was in straits for money to pay the interest for the mortgage to the bank. He could not sleep, she could not sleep, and both racked their brains till their heads ached, thinking how to avoid being visited by the clerk of the Court.</p>
<p>She saw her children: the everlasting apprehension of colds, scarlet fever, diphtheria, bad marks at school, separation. Out of a brood of five or six, one was sure to die.</p>
<p>The grey background was not untouched by death. That might well be. A husband and wife cannot die simultaneously. Whatever happened one must bury the other. And Nellie saw her husband dying. This terrible event presented itself to her in every detail. She saw the coffin, the candles, the deacon, and even the footmarks in the hall made by the undertaker.</p>
<p>"Why is it, what is it for?" she asked, looking blankly at her husband's face. And all the previous life with her husband seemed to her a stupid prelude to this.</p>
<P>Something fell from Nellie's hand and knocked on the floor. She started, jumped up, and opened her eyes wide. One looking-glass she saw lying at her feet. The other was standing as before on the table.</P>
<p>She looked into the looking-glass and saw a pale, tear-stained face. There was no grey background now. "I must have fallen asleep," she thought with a sigh of relief.</p>

</p>

<h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
<h3>a.	"The looking glass (mirror)" is used as a symbol in the story. What does it symbolise? </h3>
<p>Ans. 	The looking glass symbolizes Nellie's imagination and her desire to be married. In the story the mirror remains to be instrumental because it serves as a window to he sub-consciousness. The major part of the story revolves around the dream of Nellie and how it goes on to scare because of her inability to find the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>The looking glass offers Nellie an outlet to escape from the life that she is living. She is single and unattached woman who desires to find a man who will love her. and whom she too can love. In fact she is seeking happiness through marriage. Using her dream the story writer exhibits her internal conflict and her challenge to relate the problems with others. </p>
<p>In the story mirror remains to be important because it reveals the future. Chekhov uses this object to expose Nellie's inner feelings, her fears and the manner she continues to feel helpless. The use of looking glass makes the story successful as it brings together its goals and objectives to readers.</p>
<h3>b.	Chekhov employs the trick in the story, using a very elegant transition from reality to imagination to reality sequence. Discuss it relevance to life of young people.</h3>
<p>Ans. 	In the story the writer has used the magic trick, using a very elegant transition from reality to imagination to reality sequence. It offers a systematic explanation of the dream of the main character from the beginning of the story which continues until the character wakes up.</p>
<p>The story is set on a New Year's Eve. The story begins with the young woman who wants to get married. While staring into the mirror, she drifts into her imagination and encounters with terrifying glimpse of the future which involves a desperate attempt to save her husband from typhus. The readers can safely assume they have been transmitted completely into the realm of the imagination. This is a wonderful trick of Chekov's part. Most of the young people dream of their life as the fairy tales full of happiness and perfection. They don't recognize the difficult part. They compare themselves to the comfortable characters of the fanciful movies. The character in this story sees in the glass disabuses her of the illusion.</p>
<p>At first she sees her husband caring., lovely kind and enjoying happiness in her life. But her romance, happiness and love disperse with the husband's sickness She believes that romance is the gateway to her happiness in life. The painful realities of life and death are new to her.</p>
<P>the looking glass might be relevant to the life of young people due-to its fairy tale quality. Nellie turns herself into a distressed princes; her husband becomes afflicted prince charming.</P>
<p>Young people tend to dramatize life. They are rather over emotional and hyperbolic. Nellie might represent the ways in which she tends to glamorize, love, suffering and other things that might not be so enchanting in reality. Young people don't have experience of devastating hardship, they might be more inclined to invent their own.</p>
<p>The looking glass is relevant to the life of young people because young people have been known to create a world for themselves that is more dramatic and theatrical. The sensational nature of social media and news outlets suggests that adults travel back and forth between reality and fantasy more often than they like to admit. But young ones are in dellusion and imaginative fantasy which is broken up in the real life. Life is not that easy to face and lead. We have to face, hardships, sorrows and obstacles in each and every steps.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3>Write a couple of paragraphs about an interesting dream that you have had. </h3>
<p>Ans.
Once I had a dream about a strange animal. In my dream I was walking through a desert. I met an animal. I had not seen that animal before. When it came to me, I asked him his name. He said that his name was dinosaur, Still I could not believe my eyes. Because dinosaurs as a species are already extinct from the world. It was a baby dinosaur. So it did not harm me. Then I took care of the baby dinosaur. It grew up. It became my friend. It was indeed an admirable friendship. Once a drought affected our locality. We got little rain. There was no crop. People were starving. The dinosaur also could not get water and food. Still it did not break the friendship. It went wherever I went.

</p>
<p>One day narrated its sufferings and cried. I realised that the dinosaur was really on the verge of death. But I was helpless. It was a desert where water was impossible to be found. After a moment, the dinosaur forgot the friendship and began to yawn. He tried to satisfy his hunger by swallowing me. I was afraid of the large mouth of the dinosaur. Then I began to run and save my life. The dinosaur too ran after me. I shouted for help. Then my mother woke up and splashed water on me. I got up. The dream was suddenly broken. At that time I was sweating and trembling. My mother said that it was only a dream. Then I resumed my sense and realised that I was just dreaming. This dream as imaginary. The next evening, we saw the film "The Jurassic Park" and through it I got rid of my fear of the dinosaur which is really a dead species. I told my friends all about my dream. They laughed and enjoyed it. When my father heard it, he commented that scientists in the world are trying their best to create a living dinosaur again. If dinosaur will reappear, it will create a great danger to human existence on the earth. The dream was really very interesting. I tried to dream the same story again, but I was unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>You May Scoff...
   <br> Before you read
    </h3>
<h3>a.	Do you think that 'eating less and moving more' can be a good suggestion for health?</h3>

<p>Ans. I don't think this is an appropriate suggestion. A sound health can be maintained by doing work, taking rest, eating adequate food and exercising.</p>
<strong>Now read the following article about staying slim.</strong>

<br>
<p>Who needs diets and exercise? There are plenty of other ways to stay slim. The holidays are a time of excess. Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we diet or perhaps not! Unfortunately, we do not all have the self-discipline and determination it takes to cut back on cake and hit the gym. But fear not there could be other ways to shift the fat and stay trim.</p>
<p>Just to get this straight, if you over-eat and under exercise you will gain weight However, growing evidence suggests that other factors also contribute to excess adiposity. Last year, David Allison at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Ala., highlighted this when he discovered that humans are alone in piling on the pounds. He looked at wild animals, labi animals, even animals kept on the same highly controlled diets for decades, and found that all were becoming heavier (Proceedings of the Royal Society B, vol. 279, p. 1626). Allison concludes that whatever factors are fattening up the animals that live around us might also help explain the human obesity epidemic.</p>
<p>That being the case, identifying these alternative factors should give us new ways to fight the bulge. The good news is that researchers worldwide are beginning to do just that. It is not yet known how much each factor contributes to obesity, but we can nevertheless suggest ways of avoiding them and some are far less painful than dicting or pounding the tarmac.</p>

<p><strong>Get vaccinated</strong></p>

<p>If you catch a cold this holiday season, you may have to stock up on new clothes as well as tissues. That's because at least one common cold virus has been linked to obesity. Nikhil Dhurandhar of the Pennington Biomedical Research Centre in Louisiana discovered that adenovirus-36 (AD-36) boosts both the number of fat cells in the body and the amount of fat inside these cells. He also found that obese people are nearly
    three times as likely as those of healthy weight to test positive for AD-36 antibodies, indicating current or past infection (Obesity, vol. 14, p. 1905). Another study reported that children with AD-36 antibodies weighed an average of 23 kilograms more than children without them (Paediatrics, vol. 126, p. 721).
    </p>
<p>The "fat effect "of AD-36 might persist for several years in humans, although nobody knows for sure. Meanwhile, another 10 microbes have been reported to make animals fatter. While it sounds alarming, this could actually be good news in the fight against flab. "If indeed some infections contribute to obesity in people, we could have a potentially very simple and effective prevention strategy-vaccination, "says
   <br> Dhurandhar
    </p>
    <p><strong>Chill!</strong></p>
<p>While extreme stress tends to make people lose weight, the everyday kind can have the opposite effect. So, for the sake of your waistline, take a deep breath, and don't let the festive family bickering get to you.
    Failing that, try giving the new-year diet a miss. One recent study found that moderate calorie restriction made mice much more sensitive to stress, and this effect persisted once the diet was over. The mice went on to choose more high-fat food than those that had never had their food restricted (Journal of Neuroscience, vol. 30, p. 16399).
    </p>

<p>Brain imaging studies by Rajita Sinha, director of the Yale Stress Centre at Yale University showed that stress increases activity in the ventral striatum, a region associated with reward and habits (Neuropsychopharmacology. vol. 36, p. 627). "So it increases craving for high calorie foods in those who have a habit of consuming them," she says. Instead of counting calories, she recommends mindfulness, stress reduction and meditation techniques to cultivate an awareness of how your thoughts and behaviour can undermine your health. They can help with taking control over the urges and stress related eating of high-caloric food".</p>

<p>Everybody say "om".</p>

<p>Over the past three decades, homes in the US and UK have become warmer. Fiona Johnson at University College London and colleagues think this may be making us fatter (Obesity Review, vol. 12, p.543). Simona Bo of the University of Turin, Italy, agrees. In a study of more than 1500 middle-aged adults, her team found that those whose home temperatures ranked in the top third were about twice as likely to become obese over the six-year period of the research (International Journal of Obesity, vol. 35, p.1442). </p>
<p>Shivering obviously burns energy, but you don't need to be freezing for your body to chew through extra calories. Most fat on our bodies is a type called white fat. But when temperatures get down to about 18°C, brown fat- which is abundant in babies and which adults mostly carry around their necks-starts burning energy to warm you up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you were not regularly exposed to cold, your brown fat deposits shrink and too does your capacity to burn off that extra holiday treat. Any change will help. though, says Johnson. You burn steadily less energy as environmental temperatures rise from 15°C to 28°C. "So turning down the thermostat by any amount is likely to have some small effect," she says. Do try this at home.</p>
<p><strong>Watch the packaging</strong></p>
<p>As well as looking at the nutritional labeling, you might also want watch the actual material your food comes wrapped in. Some plastic packaging and cans contain endocrine disrupter chemicals that can leach into food and drinks, and evidence is starting to link some of these to expanding waistlines.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter6img2.jpg">
<p>Endocrine disrupters change the. normal functioning of hormones: Many interfere with the functioning of the thyroid, which produces hormones that regulate metabolic rate. One group, known as phthalates, also seems to activate a receptor in the cell nucleus called PPAR 	 (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor)- gamma, involved in storing fat and metabolizing glucose. In 2010, a team led by Elizabeth Hatch at Boston University reported that men with a bigger body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference had higher blood concentrations of metabolites of phthalate (International Journal of Andrology, vol. 33, p.324). Other research has linked obesity to exposure to bisphenol A, which is another endocrine disrupter</p>
<p>Debate continues over whether these chemicals are harmful or not, and avoiding them is tricky. But look out for PVC packaging - labeled "Type 3" for recycling purpose - which can contain phthalates or bisphenol A. And be especially wary when buying fatty foods in which endocrine disrupters tend to accumulate, posing a potential double threat.</p>
<p><strong>Turn down the lights</strong></p>
<p>If your idea of a holiday workout is lifting glasses of beer late into the night, then it's not just the extra calories you need to worry about. Randy Nelson and his team at Ohio State University in Columbus found that mice exposed to light at night weighed 10 per cent more at the end of the eight-week study than mice that had experienced a standard light/dark cycle, even though they ate the same total number of calories and did the same amount of exercise (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 107,</p>
<p>p. 18664). Several other studies have found that shift work makes people fatter. Light at night might alter circadian clock genes, changing an individual's metabolism, Nelson suggests, "It's difficult to specify an appropriate light cycle for everyone," he adds. But he recommends keeping a consistent pattern throughout the week and, if possible, avoiding blue wavelengths of light at night (New Scientist, 7 May, p.44). Produced by many LED bulbs, these are known to be especially disruptive to the circadian system. </p>
<p><Strong>Move to the country</Strong></p>

<p>A brisk walk or jog outdoors can only help in the battle against the bulge, unless you are doing it in a busy city. Breathing polluted air can cause extra fat to accumulate around your stomach and also make your cells less sensitive to insulin, increasing your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. "We believe that air pollution plays a very important role in the current obesity epidemic," says Xiaohua Xu of Ohio State University.</p>

<P>Xu exposed young mice to air heavily polluted with fine particles for 6 hours a day, five days a week, and found that after 10 weeks they had about 50 per cent more abdominal fat than mice that were fed the same diet but inhaled filtered air. The fatter mice also had elevated blood levels of a protein involved in inflammation called tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Xu believes this may help explain the changes to their fat cells, as well as their deceased sensitivity to insulin.</P>

<p>Another study found a strong link between levels of fine particulate air pollution and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in North Americans (Diabetes Care, vol. 33, p.2196). "We were shocked that the association held up as well as it did," says John Pearson at Harvard University, who led the research. Fine particles can blow around the globe so you can never entirely escape them, even if you can afford to move out of the city. But if you have a choice, it still might be worth picking a rural ramble over an urban jog.</p>

<p><Strong>Have a lie-in</Strong></p>
<p>If you need an excuse for spending more time in bed during the holidays, this could be it: too little sleep can make you fat. Simona Bo of the University of Turin, Italy, found that the adults who became obese during her six-year study slept an average of about 6.3 hours a night, compared with about 7.2 hours for those who maintained a healthier body weight. The link between sleep and weight held even when her team took into account other important causes of obesity, such as low level of physical activity. Rachael Taylor at the University of Otago, New Zealand, has found that children aged between 3 and 5 who sleep less than the average of 11 hours a night are also more likely to be overweight or obese by the time they are 7 years old. (BMJ, vol. 342, p. 2712) </p>

<p>Sleep deprivation reduces the secretion of leptin, a hormone that suppresses appetite, and increases levels of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite. "Or it could be as simple as less sleep means more time to eat", says Taylor. Either way, an extra hour in bed sure beats going to the gym.

    <h3>Now read the following autobiographical essay about Maathai's Green Belt Campaign in Kenya.</h3>
    <p>The Green Belt Movement started in my backyard. I was involved in a political campaign with a man I was married
        to; I was trying to see what I could do for the people who were helping us during our campaign, people who came
        from poor communities. I decided to create jobs for them: cleaning their constituency, planting trees and
        shrubs, cleaning homes of the richer people in the communities, and getting paid for those services. That never
        worked, because poor people wanted support right away, and I didn't have money to pay them before the people we
        were working for had paid me. So I dropped the project but stayed with the idea. Then, in 1976, two years after
        the first backyard idea, I was invited to join the National Council of Women of Kenya.<br><br>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter7_2.JPG"></p>
    We were into the UN's “women’ decade”, and I got exposed to many of the problems women were facing: problems of
    firewood, malnutrition, lack of food and adequate water, unemployment, soil erosion. Quite often what we see in
    the streets of our cities, in the rural areas, in the slums, are manifestations of mistakes we make as we
    pretend we are “developing”, as we pursue what we are now calling maldevelopment.<br><br>
    And so we decided to go to the women. Why?<br><br>
    Well, I am a woman. I was in a women's organization. Women are the ones most affected by these problems. Women are
    concerned about children, about the future.<br><br> So we went to the women and talked about planting trees and
    overcoming, for example, such problems as the lack of firewood and building and fencing materials, stopping soil
    erosion, and protecting water systems. The women agreed, although they didn't know how to do it.<br><br>
    The next few months we spent teaching them how to do it. We first called the foresters to come and show the women
    how you plant trees. The foresters proved to be very complicated because they have diplomas; they have complicated
    ways of dealing with a very simple thing like looking for seeds and planting trees. So eventually we taught the
    women to just do it using common sense and they did. They were able to look for seeds in the neighborhood, and learn
    to recognize seedlings as they germinate when seeds fall on the ground. Women do not have to wait for anybody to
    grow trees. They are really foresters without a diploma.<br><br> We started on World Environment Day, June 5, 1977;
    that's when we planted the first seven trees. Now, only two are still standing. They are beautiful Nandi flame
    trees. The rest died. But by 1988, when we counted according to the records women sent back to us, we had 10 million
    trees surviving. Many had already matured to be used by the women. But the most important thing is that the women
    were now independent; had acquired knowledge, techniques; had become empowered. They have been teaching each other.
    We started with one tree nursery in the backyard of the office of the National Council of Women. Today we have over
    1,500 tree nurseries, 99 percent run by women.<br><br> The women get a very small payment for every seedling that
    survives. The few men who come are extremely poor, so poor that they don't mind working with women. Women do a lot
    of work that requires caring. And I don't believe that it is solely indoctrination. Women started the environmental
    movement, and now it has become a movement that even financial donors see they should put money in, because the
    efforts are providing results. But the minute money is in, the men come in. I would not be surprised that eventually
    the more successful the Green Belt movement becomes, the more infiltrated it will be by men, who will be there more
    for the economic benefit than the commitment.<br><br> Although men are not involved in the planting at the nursery,
    they are involved in the planting of trees on farms. These are small-scale farmers. In our part of Africa, men own
    land; in some communities they own separate titles to the land; in others there is still communal ownership, which
    is the tradition in Africa. We are most successful in communities where women are involved in land farming.<br><br>
    In Kenya, as in so much of the African continent, 80 percent of the farmers and the fuel gatherers are women. Women
    also keep animals. A large population of Kenyans are nomadic communities: the Maasai, the Samburu, the Somalis, most
    of the northern communities. We have been unsuccessful there. Yet this is where trees are much needed. Areas that
    are green now will soon be a desert if not cared for.<br><br> We have been approached by other countries, and in
    1987 - 88 we launched what we hoped would become an effort to initiate Green Belt like activities in other African
    countries. Unfortunately, we have not been able to follow up. We started having our own problems in Kenya because of
    our having criticized the government for wanting to put up a big building in a Nairobi public park. But we are
    encouraging the establishment of a Green Belt Centre in Nairobi, where people can come and experience development
    that is community oriented, with community decision-making, and with development appropriate to the region.<br><br>
    Funding is always a problem. We never received any financial support from the Kenyan government. They gave us an
    office which they took away as soon as we criticized them. (In a way, it is good they didn't give us money because
    they would have withdrawn that.) We receive much of our support from abroad, mostly from women all over this world,
    who send us small cheques. And the United Nations Development Fund for Women gave us a big boost, \$100,000 in 1981.
    We also received support from the Danish Voluntary Fund and the Norwegian Agency for International Development. In
    the US we are supported by the African Development Foundation, which helped us make a film about the Green Belt
    Movement in 1985. Information on the film can be obtained from the Public Affairs Officer of the African Development
    Foundation, 1400 I Street, N.W.,Washington D.C. 20005.<br><br> In the field, we now have about 750 people who teach
    new groups and help with the compilation of the reports, which we monitor to have an idea of what is happening in
    the field. At the headquarters, we now have about 40 people. When we were kicked out of our office, the headquarters
    moved back to my house; a full-circle return to where we started.<br><br> But it's 10 million trees later - not
    quite where we started. For myself, now that my two boys and a girl are big - the last boy is still in high school
    when we have trained enough women in leadership and fundraising, I would love to go back into an academic
    institution. I do miss it. My field is biology. But I was into microanatomy and developmental anatomy. I would love
    to be able to read more about community development and motivation and write about the experience that I have had in
    the field. And perhaps train people on grass-roots projects. But that will have to wait. I earn maybe a tenth of
    what I could earn on the international market if I sold my expertise and energy, and I'm sure many people would
    probably consider me. a fool. At home the men don't believe that I don't make a fortune out of the Green Belt
    Movement. But all over the world we women do this sort of thing.<br><br> My greatest satisfaction is to look back
    and see how far we have come. Something so simple but meaning so much, something nobody can take away from the
    people, something that is changing the face of the landscape.<br><br> But my greatest disappointment has been since
    I returned to Kenya in 1966 after my education in the United States. When I was growing up and going through school,
    I believed that the sky's the limit. I realized when I went home that the sky is not the limit, that human beings
    can make the limit for you, stop you from pursuing your full potential. I have had to fight to make a contribution.
    We lose so much from people because we don't allow them to think freely and do what they can. So they lose their
    interest; their energy; the opportunity to be creative and positive. And developing countries need all the energy
    they can get. <br><br>I tell people that if they know how to read and write it is an advantage. But all we really
    need is a desire to work and common sense. These are usually the last two things people are asked for. They are
    usually asked to use imposed knowledge they do not relate to, so they become followers rather than
    leaders.<br><br>For example, because I criticized the political leadership, I have been portrayed as subversive, so
    it' - s very difficult for me to not feel constrained. I have the energy; I want to do exactly what they spend hours
    in the UN talking about. But when you really want to do it you are not allowed, because the political system is not
    tolerant or encouraging enough.<br><br> But we must never lose hope. When any of us feels she has an idea or an
    opportunity, she should go ahead and do it. I never knew when I was working in my backyard that I would one day
    become a whole movement. One person can make the difference.<br>

    <h2>Critical thinking</h2>
    <h3>a. a. Do you think that the title "Foresters without Diplomas" is suitable to the
        essay? How?
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The title "Forest without Diplomas" is suitable for the essay. The entire essay revolves
        around the efforts made by the rural women in Kenya to make the Green Belt movement successful.<br><br> The
        essayist and her team first called the foresters to come and show the women how they planted trees. The
        foresters proved to be very problematic because they have diplomas. They had applied difficult methods of
        dealing with the very simple things like looking for seeds and planting trees. Finally, Maathi and her team
        taught the women to do the thing using common sense and they did. They were able to look for seeds in the
        neighbourhood and learn to recognize seedling as they germinated, when seeds fell on the ground. Women did not
        have to wait for anybody to grow trees. They have been teaching each other. They are really foresters without a
        diploma. But the most important thing was that the women had been independent then, had acquired knowledge,
        techniques and had become empowered through their practical experience. Now there have been 10 millions trees
        surviving without any diploma.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Can a person make a difference in a society? Discuss with an example from a person who has made a difference
        in your society.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>It is not the fact that the simple idea make the society difference." But the truth is that
        it is quite difficult but not impossible. One simple person's simple idea may bring a drastic change in the
        particular society. If we struggle in all places we can make our society better. We can achieve greater things,
        If we find out the real sufferings and implement the programmes with their help and concern. To bring the change
        and difference in the society we should fix the right rules in favour of socially marginalized groups with
        generosity, kindness. And give them responsibility to apply themselves. The person who is concerned about others
        more than personal benefits can have an impact on them.<br><br> Dr. Sita Ram is my neighbour. He works in
        ICIMOD. He is a well-known ecologist. He runs campaigns of Green city and Clean city and Green village & clean
        village in different parts of the country. He has taught us how to keep our locality green and clean. So he has
        distributed 4 fruits to each family and told them to cut down the unwanted plant nearby the house and plant a
        fruit tree. By this villagers are now getting fresh fruits and greenery nearby the house. The local government
        and his family and social workers support him.<br><br> He is modest and simple. For him greenery and protection
        of the environment comes first. Different organizations have honored him for his pious contribution to society
        and health. We really feel proud of him.

    <p><strong>Community forest in Nepal</strong></p>
    <p>
        The community forestry program in Nepal is a government effort to reduce forest degradation and promote
        sustainable forestry practices as well as to improve the livelihood of the community. It incorporates distinct
        policies, Institutions and practices. The two main goals of the community forestry program is to empower local
        communities whilst encouraging environmental conservation benefits of the Himalayan forest.<br><br> Nepal has
        become one of the first developing nations to adopt a community forestry management program which gives
        authority and groups to manage the forest resources. As a result, Nepal now stands as one of the leaders in
        community based forest management. They have made direct progress in halting environmental degradation and by
        regenerating forests in barren areas. Studies have proven the potential benefits that community forestry will
        have in combating environmental degradation as well as utilizing resources in sufficient manner.<br><br> One of
        the two main goals under the community forest was to alleviate poverty as well as improve general livelihoods of
        the Nepal people. Various forms of discrimination on the basis of caste, economic status ethnicity, gender, age
        and vulnerability exist in Nepalese society, The key objective of this program was to increase the participation
        and empower the socially marginalized people allowing decision making abilities within the communities.<br><br>
        Now 1.6 million households are included as a community forest user group there are 19.000 community forest user
        groups. These groups are utilizing the forest resources, such as, fuel wood, timber fodder, herbal medicine,
        building materials manure from the forest. They make their own rules and regulations to manage the forest
        resources. Each and every household family equally get facility from it.<br><br> Community forestry is a
        participatory forest management system in Nepal that was started in the late 1970s. Gilmour and fisher (1991)
        defined community forestry as the control, protection, and management of forest resources by rural communities
        for whom trees and forests are an integral part of their meaning.

    <h2>Now read the following article about superstition.</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter8_1.JPG">
        In grave discussions of "the renaissance of the irrational" in our time, superstition does not figure largely as
        a serious challenge to reason or science. Parapsychology, UFOs, miracle cures, transcendental meditation, and
        all the paths to instant enlightenment are condemned, but superstition is merely deplored. Is it because it has
        an unacknowledged hold on so many of us?<br><br>Few people will admit to being superstitious; it implies naiveté
        or ignorance. But I live in the middle of a large university, and I see superstition in its four manifestations,
        alive and flourishing among people who are indisputably rational and learned.<br><br> You did not know that
        superstition takes four forms? Theologians assure us that it does. First is what they call Vain Observances,
        such as not walking under a ladder, and that kind of thing. Yet I saw a deeply learned professor of
        anthropology, who had spilled some salt, throwing a pinch of it over his left shoulder; when I asked him why, he
        replied, with a wink, that it was "to hit the Devil in the eye." I did not question him further about his belief
        in the Devil: But I noticed that he did not smile until I asked him what he was doing.<br><br> The second form
        is Divination, or consulting oracles. Another learned professor I know, who would scorn to settle a problem by
        tossing a coin (which is a humble appeal to Fate to declare itself), told me quite seriously that he has
        resolved a matter related to university affairs by consulting the I Ching. And why not? There are thousands of
        people on this continent who appeal to the I Ching, and their general level of education seems to absolve them
        of superstition. Almost, but not quite. The I Ching, to the embarrassment of rationalists, often gives excellent
        advice.<br><br>The third form is Idolatry, and universities can show plenty of that. If you have ever supervised
        a large examination room, you know how many jujus, lucky coins, and other bringers of luck are placed on the
        desks of the candidates. Modest idolatry, but what else can you call it? <br><br>The fourth form is Improper
        Worship of the True God. A while ago, I learned that every . For several days, a \$2 bill (in Canada we have \$2
        bills, regarded by some people as unlucky) had been tucked under a candlestick on the alfar of a college chapel.
        Investigation revealed that an engineering student, worried about a girl, thought that bribery of the Deity
        might help. When I talked with him, he did not think he was pricing God cheap because he could afford no more. A
        reasonable argument, but perhaps God was proud that week, for the scientific oracle went against him.<br><br>
        Superstition seems to run, a submerged river of crude religion, below the surface of human consciousness. It has
        done so for as long as we have any chronicle of human behaviour, and although I cannot prove it, I doubt if it
        is more prevalent today than it has always been. Superstition, the theologians tell us, comes from the Latin
        supersisto, meaning to stand in terror of the Deity. Most people keep their terror within bounds, but they
        cannot root it out, nor do they seem to want to do so.<br><br> The more the teaching of formal religion
        declines, or takes a sociological form, the less God appears to great numbers of people as a God of Love,
        resuming his older form of a watchful, minatory power, to be placated and cajoled. Superstition makes its
        appearance, apparently unbidden, very early in life, when children fear that stepping on cracks in the sidewalk
        will bring ill fortune. It may persist even among the greatly learned and devout, as in the case of Dr. Samuel
        Johnson, who felt it necessary to touch posts that he passed in the street. The psychoanalysts have their
        explanation, but calling a superstition a compulsion neurosis does not banish it.<br><br> Many superstitions are
        so widespread and so old that they must have risen from a depth of the human mind that is indifferent to race or
        creed. Orthodox Jews place a charm on their doorposts; so do (or did) the Chinese. Some peoples of Middle Europe
        believe that when a man sneezes, his soul, for that moment, is absent from his body, and they hasten to bless
        him, lest the soul be seized by the Devil. How did the Melanesians come by the same idea? Superstition seems to
        have a link with some body of belief that far antedates the religions we know of which have no place for such
        comforting little ceremonies and charities.<br><br> People who like disagreeable historical ceremonies recall
        that when Rome was in decline, superstition proliferated wildly, and that something of the same sort is
        happening in our Western world today. They point to the popularity of astrology, and it is true that sober
        newspapers that would scorn to deal in love philters carry astrology columns and the fashion magazines count
        them among their most popular features. But when has astrology not been popular? No use saying science
        discredits it. When has the heart of man given a damn for science?<br><br> Superstition in general is linked to
        man's yearning to know his fate, and to have some hand in deciding it. When my mother was a child, she
        innocently joined her Roman Catholic friends in killing spiders on July 11, until she learned that this was done
        to ensure heavy rain the day following, the anniversary of the Battle of Boyne, when the Orangemen would hold
        their parade. I knew an Italian, a good scientist, who watched every morning before leaving his house, so that
        the first person he met would not be a priest or a nun, as this would certainly bring bad luck.<br><br> I am not
        one to stand aloof from the rest of humanity in this matter, for when I was a university student, a gypsy woman
        with a child in her arms used to appear every year at examination time, and ask a shilling of anyone who touched
        the Lucky Baby; that swarthy infant cost me four shillings altogether, and I never failed an examination. Of
        course, I did it merely for the joke or so I thought then. Now, I am humbler.<br><br>

        confusing, expectations. On the other hand, religion is an integrated system of beliefs in a god or
        goddess, and the activities that are connected with this belief Superstition is so widespread and so old
        that they must have risen from a depth of the human mind that is indifferent to race or religion.
    </p>
    <h3>e. What is the belief of some people in the Middle Europe about sneezing?</h3>

        from his body and they hasten to bless him, lest the soul will be seized by the Devil.
    </p>
    <h3>f. In the author's view, why are people so fascinated about superstition?</h3>

        people's desire to know about their fate and have some hand in deciding it.
    </p>
    <h2>Critical thinking</h2>
    <h3>a. What is the key takeaway of this essay? Do you think that this essay is satirical? Why?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>This essay revolves around the concept of superstition. It aims to change the usual view that
        superstition is only harbored by the uneducated and irrational people. It introduces a different
        perspective towards superstition. Every individual, no matter how logical or rational they are, carries
        superstitions. The writer believes that many superstitions are so widespread and old that must have
        risen from a death of human mind that is different to any race or creed. For him, superstition is
        associated with human interest to know his fate and to have its role in deciding it.<br><br>The essay is satirical. It makes fun of learned and educated people who have nothing to do with
        superstition, but believe in it. The writer uses several examples associated with superstition, from his
        personal first-hand experience at the university and daily life in his surroundings. The essayist strongly
        
        ridicules the scientific rationality and modern human civilization. He exemplifies his claim with some
        defining examples, such as throwing salt over the left shoulder after spilling it, or avoiding walking
        under a ladder, resolving a matter related to university affairs by consulting the / Ching, placing jujus,
        lucky coins, and other bringers of luck on the desks of the candidates in an examination hall. The
        writer mocks at his own superstitious behaviour in giving four shillings to touch a lucky baby before
        taking exams in college, later revealing that he did it for the joke.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Can education bring change in the belief of superstition? Present your arguments to support your
        answer.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Yes, education can bring change in the belief of superstition. It improves cognitions and the ability of
        reasoning something. Educated people are less likely to be superstitious. They can make others aware
        of the evil practices and blind imitations. Moreover, they refer the sick to the hospitals rather than to
        the witch doctors. Only educated people can play a significant role in eradicating anti-social
        superstitious, beliefs.
    </p>
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <h3>a. Write an essay on superstitions that exists in your community in about 250 words.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>People believe in some power beyond their comprehension. Such belief in unseen power is what we
        commonly regard as superstition. As a matter of fact, the human mind and human soul keeps on
        believing that there is some hidden power somewhere which governs their lives and this the basis of
        some of these superstitions. There is no logic, rationality or scientific explanation behind beliefs in the
        superstitions. These century-old phenomena continue to exist despite advancement of science and
        technology.<br><br>In Nepal, many superstitious beliefs are in existence. Number 13 is considered and unlucky number.
        When someone sneezes during the time of departure, people consider it unlucky. Similarly, people
        consider long mewing of a cat a bad omen. Similar is the case of an owl hooting or a dog wailing.
        Besides, a black cat crossing the path is also regarded as an unlucky sign. Other most common
        superstitions are: not cutting nails at night, not using the broom after sunset, not opening the scissors
        without cutting anything, and not looking at oneself in a broken mirror. Nepalese also offer curd
        before the start of a journey. Moreover, a pot full of milk or water being carried in front on the onset
        of a journey is an auspicious thing. Visiting a temple prior to proceeding for the examination is a
        common practice among Nepalese students. Furthermore, almost all the political leaders are found
        waiting for the auspicious day or the auspicious hour to file their nominations for elections or take the
        oath of office.
    </p>
    <h3>b. &quot;Superstition is prevalent in every walk of life.&quot; Argue for or against this statement.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Superstition generally means a belief in supernatural forces, such as false desire to influence
        unpredictable factors and a need to resolve uncertainty. Individual beliefs and experiences drive
        superstitions. Both educated and illiterate people pursue the superstitious beliefs in their lives.<br><br>For many people, engaging with superstitious behaviours provide a sense of control and reduces
        anxiety. Superstitious beliefs have been used to promote a positive mental attitude despite the fact
        that they can lead to irrational decisions. Our daily life is so deeply rooted in superstition that we seek
        lucky and unlucky explanations every now and then.

        Now, read a short biography of Nelson Mandela and his Inauguration Speech.
        Nelson Mandela, in full Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, byname Madiba, (born July 18, 1918 died December 5,
        2013), was a black nationalist and the first black president of South Africa (1994-99). He fought against
        apartheid, a policy that governed relations. between South Africa&#39;s white minority and nonwhite majority and
        sanctioned racial segregation and political and economic discrimination against nonwhites.<br><br>
        He sacrificed his private life and his youth for his people. He spent 27 years in prison for his protests and
        became the world&#39;s most famous political prisoner. He continued to fight until peace, justice and stability
        was
        established in the country. Later, he became the first Black President of South Africa through the democratic
        election Nelson Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa. He was a member of the Thembu tribe, and his
        father was the chief of the Thembu people. He got a good modern education.<br><br>
        When he was sixteen, he was sent to a boarding school. He attended South African Native College (later the
        University of Fort Hare) and studied law at the University of the Witwatersrand, he later passed the
        qualification exam to become a lawyer. In 1944, he joined the African National Congress (ANC) and continued
        to oppose the apartheid policies of the ruling National Party. Nelson and the other ANC leaders organized
        strikes and several other protests. Mandela was charged with organizing an armed wing of the ANC, and was
        arrested in 1962. As a result, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.<br><br>
        Nelson Mandela was the most famous prisoner in the world for his anti-apartheid movement. He refused to
        compromise his political position to obtain his personal freedom from the prison. He wanted all people of all
        races to have equal rights in South Africa Free Mandela became a rallying cry throughout the world.
        After a long campaign of resistance within South Africa and the international pressure, President FW de Klerk
        released Mandela from prison in 1990, after 27 years. After his release, Mandela continued his campaign to
        end apartheid, and establish justice and peace in South Africa. As a result, Mandela was awarded the Nobel
        Peace Prize in 1993.<br><br>
        One year later in April 1994, a national election was held, and that was open to all South Africans. Nelson
        Mandela, who represented the ANC, won the election and became the first Black President of South Africa.
        The inauguration of South Africa&#39;s first Black President was attended by politicians and dignitaries from
        more
        than 140 countries around the world.<br><br>
        Here is the Inaugural Speech delivered by Nelson Mandela in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, on May
        10, 1994;<br><br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter9_2.JPG">
        Your Majesties; Your Royal Highnesses, Distinguished Guests, Comrades and Friends! Today, all of us do, by our
        presence here, and by our celebrations in other parts of our country and the world, confer glory and hope to
        newborn liberty.<br><br>
        Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted too long, must be born a society of which
        all humanity will be proud.<br><br>
        Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality. that will reinforce
        humanity's belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul and sustain all our
        hopes for a glorious life for all.<br><br>
        All this we owe both to ourselves and to the people of the world who are so well represented here today.<br><br>
        To my compatriots. I have no hesitation in saying that each one of us is as intimately attached to the soil of
        this beautiful country as are the famous jacaranda trees of Pretoria and the mimosa trees of the
        bushveld.<br><br>
        Each time one of us touches the soil of this land, we feel a sense of personal renewal. The national mood
        changes as the seasons change. <br><br>
        We are moved by a sense of joy and exhilaration when the grass tums green and the flowers bloom.<br><br>
        That spiritual and physical oneness we all share with this common homeland explains the depth of the pain we all
        carried in our hearts as we saw our country tear itself apart in a terrible conflict, and as we saw it spumed,
        outlawed and isolated by the people of the world, precisely because it has become the universal base of the
        pernicious ideology and practice of racism and racial oppression.<br><br>
        We, the people of South Africa, feel fulfilled that humanity has taken us back into its bosom, that we, who were
        outlaws not so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host to the nations of the world on our
        own soil.<br><br>
        We thank all our distinguished international guests for having come to take possession with the people of our
        country of what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for pence, for human dignity.<br><br>
        We trust that you will continue to stand by us as we tackle the challenges of building peace, prosperity,
        non-sexism, non-racialism and democracy.<br><br>
        We deeply appreciate the role that the masses of our people and their political mass democratic, religious,
        women, youth, business, traditional and other leaders have played to bring about this conclusion. Not least
        among them is my Second Deputy President, the Honourable F.W. de Klerk.<br><br>
        We would also like to pay tribute to our security forces, in all their ranks, for the distinguished role they
        have played in securing our first democratic elections and the transition to democracy, from blood-thirsty
        forces which still refuse to see the light.<br><br>
        The time for the healing of the wounds has come.<br><br>
        The moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come.<br><br>
        The time to build is upon us.<br><br>
        We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the
        continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.<br><br>
        We succeeded in taking our last steps to freedom in conditions of relative peace. We commit ourselves to the
        construction of a complete, just and lasting peace.<br><br>
        We have triumphed in the effort to implant hope in the breasts of millions of our people. We enter into a
        covenant that we shall build the society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk
        tall, without any fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity - a rainbow nation
        at peace with itself and the world.<br><br>
        As a token of its commitment to the renewal of our country, the new Interim Government of National Unity will,
        as a matter of urgency, address the issue of amnesty for various categories of our people who are currently
        serving terms of imprisonment.<br><br>
        We dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroines in this country and the rest of the world who sacrificed in
        many ways and surrendered their lives so that we could be free. <br><br>
        Their dreams have become reality, Freedom is their reward.<br><br>
        We are both humbled and elevated by the honour and privilege that you, the people of South Africa, have bestowed
        on us, as the first President of a united, democratie, nonracial and non-sexist South Africa, to lead our
        country out of the valley of darkness. <br><br>
        We understand it still that there is no easy road to freedom.<br><br>
        We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve success.<br><br>
        We must therefore act together as a united people, for national reconciliation, for nation building, for the
        birth of a new world.<br><br>
        Let there be justice for all.<br><br>
        Let there be peace for all.<br><br>
        Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.<br><br>
        Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves.<br><br>
        Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by
        another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world.<br><br>
        Let freedom reign,<br><br>
        The sun shall never set on such glorious human achievement!<br><br>
        God bless Africa!<br><br>
        Thank you.

        including race, ethnicity or nationality. This term is usually used to describe a condition of inequality Many
        societies have struggled with this problem in the world. Racial segregation is one of the most common forms of
        segregation. It is constitutionally forbidden all over the world. However, it still manages to survive through
        social norms and practices. Racial segregation has appeared in all parts of the world where there are
        multiracial communities. Having said that, we can't turn a blind eye to segregation lews, homosexuals, females,
        marginalized groups and so on.<br><br>
        The constitution of Nepal doesn't endure any segregation in terms of religion, caste and ethnicity. However,
        untouchability, racial discrimination, gender inequality is still prevalent in our society.<br><br>
        Marginalized social groups are still kept at an arm's length from policy
        Poverty-based segregation is also prominent in our country.

        July 1924. Affectionately called Girija Babu, he headed Nepali Congress and served as the prime minister of
        Nepal on four occasions: from 1991 to 1994, 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001 and from 2006 to 2008. He was the acting
        head of state of Nepal between January 2007 and July 2008 when the country. transitioned from monarchy to a
        republic.<br><br>
        Koirala who was active in politics for over sixty years. He was a pioneer of the Nepalese labour movement,
        having started the first political workers' movement (the Biratnagar Jute Mill Strike) in Nepal. In 1991, he

        congress party were brought into power in the country's first democratic election.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Do you think there is racial/caste related discrimination in our country? Discuss with your friend: Write a
        five-minute speech.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The government of Nepal has repeatedly expressed a commitment to eliminate caste and racial
        based discrimination from the country. However, these discriminatory practices are still prevalent in our
        country as they find their roots in culture and tradition. The so-called untouchable castes are the subjects of
        continuous torture and oppression at the hand of the privileged groups. For instance, Dalit women are extremely
        vulnerable to sexual exploitation. Among them, Badi and landless groups are forced to survive by means of flesh
        trade. Although they don't want to, poverty, and social stigmatization make them bound to pursuit. Moreover,
        they are routinely refused entry into public temples, tea shops, public wells and taps. They are denied the
        right to sell milk and open tea-shops. Most seriously, their right to marry with free consent is also withheld.
        Political leaders are using the issues of the marginalized caste groups for their own benefits. They promise to
        eliminate the caste discrimination and ensure equity and human dignity. However, these vows are merely
        restricted to the words rather than actions.<br><br>
        Caste-based discrimination must be treated as a matter of requiring the introduction and effective
        implementation of laws that will hold the perpetrators of abuses responsible for their actions. It is an
        imperative to ensure adequate compensation for the victims. Strong laws should be drafted against the
        discriminatory tendencies.

    <h3>Now read the following story.</h3>
    <p>
        When he arrived unexpectedly at his home in the countryside in his office jeep and got down at the gate, his
        mother, who was lying in an armchair on the veranda, made a futile attempt to get up.
    </p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11eng_ch10_2.jpg">
    <p>
        'Kamalam, there is somebody at the gate, she said, 'somebody in a car."<br><br>
        Kamalam, her eldest daughter, a widow, who was sitting huddled up on the thinna on the veranda, her head and
        cars covered with a thin bath towel, got up reluctantly, walked slowly to the gate and screwing up her eyes
        peered into the darkness. <br><br>
        She saw a bald, fat, middle-aged man walking in through the gate. <br><br>
        'Oh, Gopi!' She said in her grating voice. "Why this sudden unexpected visit?" 'Kamalam, who is it?' Her mother
        asked loudly from the veranda.<br><br>
        Gopi," the man said. There was a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram. I just dropped in on my way back."<br><br>
        'Who? Kamalam, who is it?' There was a note of alarm in Amma's voice.<br><br>
        'Amma, why are you so scared? Kamalam, Gopi's eldest sister, asked her a little awkwardly. As if you are seeing
        Gopi for the first time!'<br><br>
        Amma, it's me, Gopi," he said again.<br><br>
        He bent down and brought his face close to her wrinkled cheeks. 'Amma, it's me." 'Gopi? Kamalam, I can't believe
        it! Has his school closed for the vacation?"<br><br>
        'Amma is often like this these days. She doesn't recognise anybody. Gopi's sister explained. But sometimes her
        memory is quite sharp. Then she asks me if you have sent any letter. I tell her everything is fine with you,
        Vimala and the kids. What is the point of telling her that you haven't written for a year? Poor thing! I
        wouldn't dream of making her unhappy.'<br><br>
        'I got a promotion last year. After that, I am always on my toes. And there are tours quite often. I don't get
        any time to write letters."<br><br>
        'Why don't you ask Vimala to write, or doesn't she get any time, either?'<br><br>
        'What are you mumbling over there?' Amma said loudly. I heard somebody coming in a car. Who is it??<br><br>
        'I told you, it's Gopi.'<br><br>
        'But Gopi is in Delhi, isn't he?'<br><br>
        'Yes, Amma, it's me. I've come from Delhi.'<br><br>
        'Who did Gopi marry? Amma said, suddenly lowering her voice. I mean, what's his wife's name?'<br><br>
        'Don't say you've forgotten her name too. Don't you remember. Vimala, District
        Collector Nambiar's eldest daughter?' Gopi's sister said.<br><br>
        'Oh, I forgot the name, Was there a letter from Gopi today?'<br><br>
        'There was. He writes every day.'<br><br>
        'I'm terribly upset if I don't get a letter from him every day.'<br><br>
        'He knows it. That's why he writes every day.'<br><br>
        'Look at the way she talks Gopi's sister turned to him. 'Just as I told you. You know nothing about what's going
        on here, do you?'<br><br>
        "Who is that?" Amma said again. 'Who is that in a car?"<br><br>
        'It' s me,' Gopi said. 'I had to come to Thiruvananthapuram. I thought I should drop in to see you,
        Amma.'<br><br>
        'Who is your Amma? What is her name? Where does she live? Is it far from here?'<br><br>
        'No, it is quite near. <br><br>'I don't know how I can bring back her memory, Gopi's sister said to him
        exasperatedly.'<br><br>
        Gopi placed his briefcase on the thinna. He opened it and pulled out the contents. <br>
        Clothes, files, a shaving set...<br><br>
        'Do you know my son, Gopi?" Amma asked him. He is in Delhi... a Government Officer. He has well-settled.... He
        draws a salary of two thousand five hundred rupees.<br><br>
        'Do you know him?'<br><br>
        'Yes, I know him.'<br><br>
        'Tell him to send me a blanket. There is a cold mist in the mornings. If I catch a cold, it doesn't leave me for
        a long time. Tell him to send a blanket, won't you? A red one. I had a blanket, the one he bought for me when he
        was studying in Madras. It is all tattered now, just a ball of knotted yam. Tell him to send me a red blanket,
        will you?' <br><br>
        'I'll tell him,' he nodded.<br><br>
        'Please don't forget to tell him. The mist is not good for me. I think I'll stretch myself out for a bit. I have
        been sitting too long in the armchair. I have a pain in the neck.' <br><br>
        Gopi's sister put Amma to bed and came back to the veranda.<br><br>
        'You didn't come to see Amma, did you?'<br><br>
        'Delhi is too expensive. You know I have four children to look after now. I can't make ends meet with my salary.
        And one has to keep up one's status. It will be a great help if I can raise some money by selling my share of
        the family property. I came to talk it over with you.'<br><br>
        You'll sell your land and go away with the money. I know you won't come anymore after that."<br><br>
        'Don't say that. I'll come when I get time.'<br><br>
        'Your time!'<br><br>
        He saw the irritation on his sister's face.<br><br>
        "It took you more than five years to find time to come here. Amma is eighty-three now. I don't think she will
        pull on much longer. It took you so long to visit her after the last time.'<br><br>
        'But Amma can't remember who I am, he said smiling feebly'. <br><br>
        'But do you remember your Amma?'<br><br>

    <h2>Comprehension</h2>
    <h3>Answer the following questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a. Why didn't the mother recognise her son Gopi? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The mother didn't recognize her son Gopi because her memory power was not working quite
        well as she was very old.<br><br>
        <strong>b. Why is the sister living with her mother?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The sister is living with her mother because she is a widow and there is nobody to take
        care of her mother.<br><br>
        <strong>c. What is the sister's attitude towards her brother?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>She is very critical of her brother.<br><br>
        <strong>d. Does the son love his mother very much? How do you know that?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>No, he does not love his mother at all. He has not paid her a visit for around 5 years. He
        has not written to her either. He does not care for his mother. He gives more attention to his wife, children
        and job.<br><br>
        <strong>What does the mother actually need: a blanket or the warmth of her son's love?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The mother actually needs the warmth of her son's love. The blanket symbolizes love and
        care.<br><br>
        <strong>f. What does the phrase the 'tattered blanket' mean? Is it only the blanket that is
            tattered?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The phrase the tattered blanket means 'the broken bondage or love' . The blanket is symbol
        of love & care. It is not only the blanket which is tattered, it is also the lost love.<br><br>
        <strong>g. The son says, 'Amma can't remember who I am. Do you think that he remembered his mother? Why didn't
            he answer when his sister asked, 'Do you remember your Amma?'</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I don't think that the son remembers his mother either. All he cares for is the share of
        his parental property. He didn't answer his sister's question because he had no words to tell. His selfishness
        and greed was transparent. He could not hide the same from his sister. He came there for property, not for his
        mother.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>(a) What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at the old age?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>People become both physically and mentally weak at the old age. Every aging parent has
        some expectations from their children. They wish their children to look after them. Moreover, they expect their
        sons and daughters to be the supportive partners of their difficult times. They basically expect love,
        affection, respect and care. Besides, they want their children to listen to and talk to them. However, most of
        the children disappoint their parents. They lack understanding and empathy. They neglect the old people's wishes
        as they keep their own family in priority.<br><br>
        <strong>(b) Some children who live in a distance tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do
            you think they are like that? Discuss.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Grown-up children leave their family and home for several reasons. Some of them do so nto
        continue their study. Others live in a distance for a job or business, their goal. They invest entirety of their
        time and effort to achieve the pursued goals. This tendency creates a gap or distance between parents and their
        children. <br><br> As the children come of their age, money and success becomes more important to them than the
        parents' feelings. They do hard work for prestige and position instead of living up their parents' expectations.
        They prefer to immerse themselves in the materialistic world. Visiting parents, spending time with them and
        listening to their real experience becomes a matter boredom for them. They wish to spend their valuable time
        with their own children instead of keeping track of their dying parents. This kind of indifference not only
        degrades the relationship between the parents and their children but also makes the parents' life lonely and
        miserable. <br><br>
        <strong>(c) A mother's love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Mother is the symbol of love, patience, and forgiveness. She manifests unconditional love.
        Everything becomes futile in front of a mother's love. A mother is a child's best friend, mentor, teacher, and
        caretaker. She plays a great role in t shaping an individual's life with proper nourishment and care. In
        addition to nursing, she is also key to teach her family members countless moral, cultural and societal norms
        and values. Needless to say, she is the emotional foundation of the family. She supports everyone's feeling in a
        family. She forgives everyone. We can share our problems with her without any fear. She always comes up with
        constructive solutions of our issues. Her love for children and other family members can in no way be compared
        with anything. She is the most imperative person in everyone's life. To wrap up, her love is everlasting and
        indispensable.

    "Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire, you will what you imagine and at last you create what you will." (कल्पना सिर्जनाको सुरुवात हो । चाहना गर्नुहुन्छ त्यो कल्पना गर्नुहुन्छ, तपाईंले जे कल्पना गर्नुहुन्छ र अन्त्यमा तपाईंले जे चाहानुहुन्छ त्यो सिर्जना गर्नुहुन्छ ।)

<h3>Now read the following article about the changes that occurred in the Renaissance period.</h3>

<p>During the Middle Ages (from about 500 C.E. to the mid-1400s) there were no great changes in the way of life in Europe. People did what their forefathers did before them, and there were few new inventions or discoveries. Most people believed in what they were told and did not care about anything outside their lives. One reason for this may be because only a few people received an education, and books were scarce. Then, a change began. People became better educated, trade and industry developed, the arts flourished. and explorers discovered new lands. We call this great change the Renaissance, which in French means "rebirth". The Renaissance, which took place in Europe between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, was a new stage in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Some people think that the Renaissance got started when the Turks took over the Greek city Constantinople (now Istanbul) in 1453. Greek scholars left Constantinople and settled in other parts of Europe. In these new locations, they taught Greek and shared their precious books. The study of classical Greek and Roman writers and thinkers began again, and a new desire for learning spread throughout Europe. </p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter11img2.jpg">


<p>People began to inquire into everything, and some began to question their beliefs and ways of thinking. In Germany, Martin Luther started a revolt against the conventions of the Roman Catholic Church. Soon, other Christians agreed that the Church needed to change, and several new Christian reli gions were established.
    Other people began to think about new types of government that were based on the democratic values of ancient Greece. Italy, the birthplace of the Renaissance, was organized into city-states that governed themselves. Though wealthy families and the Church held much of the power in these areas, the city-states were moving a step in the direction of government by people. The most famous political thinker of the Renaissance was Niccolo Machiavelli. In his book on government entitled The Prince, he stated that a good leader could do bad and dishonest things in order to preserve his power and protect his government. Though people in his own time thought that Machiavelli was evil for saying these things, his book is now famous and modern political thinkers respect some of his ideas.
    </p>
<P>The "new learning" taught people to think in new ways, and it also encouraged gifted people to paint pictures, make statues and buildings, and write great literature. In fact, some of the best artists of the day did all of these things. As a result, when a person today is skilled in many areas, he or she is often called a "Renaissance man" or a "Renaissance woman".
    The artistic developments of the Renaissance first happened in the Italian city of Florence, and then they spread to other Italian cities. As a result of trade and banking, cities like Florence, Venice, and Milan became very wealthy, and their rich citizens had both the time and money to enjoy music, art, and poetry. These cities produced great painters and sculptors, like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael. These artists created some of history's finest works of art. For example, Michelangelo spent four years painting thousands of feet of curved ceiling in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. To do this, he had to learn a whole new style of painting. He also had to paint lying on his back beneath the ceiling as paint dripped down onto his face. Despite these obstacles, he created one of art's greatest masterpieces.
    </P>

<p>A new kind of architecture also began in the Renaissance. It blended the old, classical styles with new ideas. Again, it started in Florence. A cathedral had been started in 1296, but it remained unfinished for over 100 years because no one could figure out how to build the curved roof that it needed. Then architect Filippo Brunelleschi invented a new type of dome that was higher and grander than any from the classical era. The dome marks the beginning of Renaissance architecture. </p>
<p>From Italy, interest in the arts and new ways of thinking spread to other countries. The Netherlands became famous for great painters; England produced many writers, including William Shakespeare; and Spain had the literature of Cervantes. The new passion for learning also led to amazing discoveries in science by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. Some of these findings went against the most basic beliefs of the time. For example, Galileo's discovery that the sun, not the Earth, was the centre of the solar system got him into serious trouble with many religious people. They forced him to say that he had been wrong about his discovery, even though he knew he was right.</p>

<p>The development of the printing press in Germany by a man named Johannes Gutenberg helped more than anything to spread the new ideas of the Renaissance. Before that time, books were scarce and very expensive because they were written by hand. Gutenberg discovered how to use a moveable metal type, and his first book was published in 1455. Printing was a very important invention. With it, books were made more cheaply and quickly than ever. In addition, most books had been written in Latin before, as this was thought to be the language of study. However, with the Renaissance, the middle classes. could now afford books, and they wanted books in their own languages. They also wanted a greater variety of things to read, such as books on travel, poetry, and romance. Printing helped make the works of the best writers and all kinds of knowledge available to all.</p>

<p>About the time printing was discovered, sailors were setting out on voyages of discovery. Now that the Turks were masters of the eastern Mediterranean, it was no longer possible to trade with India by the old land route. A new way had to be found, perhaps by sailing around the coast of Africa or perhaps by sailing around the world! There were many explorers around this time, including Columbus, Vasco de Gama, Cabot, Magellan, and Drake. Representing countries throughout Europe, these men sailed new waters and discovered new lands, including the Americas. With all this travel, tools for exploration and navigation improved, and better ships were made. As people traveled, they gained new ideas that helped to change their way of living. For example, Europeans now wanted goods - such as spices, silk, and gold - from far away countries.</p>

<p>The Renaissance didn't begin suddenly when Constantinople was taken over by the Turks or when the first book was printed in 1455. Forces that brought it about had been developing for many years as Europeans began to desire and gain new knowledge. From this new learning came the great changes that we call the Renaissance. These advancements from the discovery of printing to a renewed interest in art and literature and the discovery of new lands-affected almost every area of European life. They also formed the basis for many parts of our modern life and beliefs. This is why some people think of the Renaissance as the beginning of modern history.

<p>Ans.	Several factors reveal that a good leader can sometimes lose his way and turn immoral and evil. He accumulates the political power and position like addiction. A person is hardly disinterested in losing the position he holds. He disobeys and breaks the established rules to save his power and protect his stance. The leader whose goal is t the search of power, boundless wealth and fame often appears self centered. There is every chance that he will go to any extent in attaining his desired goal. In this regard, Machiavelli's argument is justifiable. However, there are some leaders who don't subscribe to bad and did honest things to protect their chairs or prowess. </p>

<h3>
    b.	Do you think that art and literature are important assets of a country? Give reasons.
    </h3>

<p>Ans.	Art and literature have social, cultural and economic value. As a matter of fact, they represent the entire nation and whole human society. They are our identity. These national emblems are undoubtedly important assets of a nation. Art and literature allow people from different time periods and cultures to communicate with each other through images, sounds and stories. They are often a medium for social change. It can give a voice to the politically or socially marginalized. They also give our nation a worldwide recognition. They are helpful. in boosting the economic status of a particular country by creating employment opportunities.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3>a.	Write an essay on "Literature is the reflection of society."</h3>
<p>Ans.	Literature is the reflection of society. It reflects the attitude and perception of the society. It mirrors the vices of the society with a view to make society realize its mistake and make amends. In fact, it portrays human life and action through the agency of some characters who convey certain message through words for the purpose of instruction, information and delight. It is impossible to find a work of literature that excludes the attitudes, morale and values of the society, since every writer is a part and partial of the society to which he or she belongs to. Literature records the real-life events and converts them into fiction, in the process, presenting them to the society as a mirror in which people may look at their own image and make amends wherever necessary. Stories or acts are carefully and beautifully crafted based on life of real people. It is the mirror of life because it reflects and comments on aspects that the people encounter in their daily lives. So social norms, values, myths, systems, people's way of life, religion, and faith get proper portrayal at the hand of literature.
    In a nutshell, literature serves as a beacon of light guiding people to find the right path.
    </p>
<h3>b.	It is said that today's reader is tomorrow's leader. Do you agree with this
    statement? Explain.
    </h3>
<p>Ans.	To become a leader, it is essential for all-round development of the personality. Reading is an essential skill in building one's disposition. His/her language fluency is determined by quality of reading. Besides, vocabulary enrichment and familiarization with different types of writing formats also depends on reading. If a leader doesn't have habit of reading, he doesn't know the political systems, social reforms and ways of making his country prosperous. He gets knowledge pertaining to real history, philosophy imagery, socio-cultural values of the world's history, through vigorous reading. Having said that, one furnishes leadership skills learning from others which requires reading. Moreover, to acquire new insight, s/he has to read as much as s/he can. Reading books, article, blogs or magazines becomes credible evidences for our projects, strategies, and plans. Comparative reading challenges pre-existing ideas, providing us with more complete understanding of subjects and generating healthy debate.</p>
<p>Reading gives us insights into the fields outside our own experience. We can apply such understanding into the field of our expertise in many ways. It improves our awareness of the world around. We learn from the mistakes of others. Reading also helps us to get inspiration from the great leaders before us. Hence, in all cultures and civilization much emphasis is laid on reading.</p>

<h3>c.	Write a short biography of a national literary, artistic or historical figure you appreciate most.</h3>
<p>
Ans.
<br>
<strong><u>Laxmi Prasad Devkota</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
    Laxmi Prasad Devkota is known among us as the Mahakabi or Poet the Great--the title given by the state for his unmatchable contribution to Nepali literature. He deserves that title as he had done so much in this field through his genre of writing that has earned a greatest honour and respect in the heart of Nepali speaking population both at home and abroad.
    </p>
<p>Devkota was born on the night of Laxmi Puja in 1966 BS to Tilmadhav Devkota and Amar Rajya Laxmi Devi in Dillibazar, Kathmandu. As he was born at a time when the entire Hindus including his family were worshiping Goddess Laxmi, the Goddess of wealth, his parents took his birth as the greatest gift of Goddess Laxmi. Accordingly, his name was given Laxmi Prasad. However, he turned out to be the gift of Saraswati, the Goddess of Knowledge'.</p>
<p>Devkota good in both Nepali and English language and could write in both the languages. Right from the early age, he was keen in Nepali literature. At the early age of ten, he wrote a poem when he was studying in Drubar High School the school set up for the education of the ruling Rana children. The ordinary people had to seek special permission to study in this school. Laxmi Prasad Devkota's father also had to run from pillar and post to ensure admission for his son in the Durbar High School.</p>

<p>Devkota and his friends were keen on generating awareness among the people and educating them. They decided to establish a library to generate public awareness. They had to seek permission from the government even to establish a library during those days. Devkota and his friends, thus, were put behind bars for trying to
    establish a library. As a result, poet Devkota had to undergo a great suffering. He was later fined and released. Devkota then went to Benaras, India, where he used to sell his poems for his survival. He also worked as an editor of Yugbani magazine in Benaras and gave continuity to his writing. </p>

<p>After he returned to Kathmandu, he wrote Muna Madan - an epic poem based on folk verses. Although, Devkota has written many books including some of his masterpieces, he loved Muna Madan the best. It is said that Devkota, when he was in death bed, had asked his friends and relatives to preserve Muna Madan even if all other works were to be burnt. 
    Muna Madan is perhaps the most popular of all works of Devkota. The simplicity of language, folk and lyrical verses and thythmic expression made this book popular among the all including ordinary folks. Muna Madan's popularity also made Ranas to appoint Devkota a member of the Nepal Bhasanuwad Parishad. During this period, Devkota wrote the epic, Shakuntala, in three months. It is said that Puskar Shumshere Rana challenged him to write another epic in a period of one month. Accepting the challenge, Devkota wrote another epic Sulochana in ten days. Both Shakuntal and Sulochana are Devkota's masterpieces. For sometimes, he worked as a lecturer in Trichandra College. He also served as Education Minister for three months.
    </p>
<p>Although Devkota started writing during the Rana period when the free thinking and creative writing used to be discouraged, be broke the traditional and conventional style and introduced a new genre and approach in writing poems and other forms of literature. Devkota is a versatile writer and has written pomes, epics, prose, essays, plays and fictions. But he is basically a poet. He was influenced by western poets like William Wordsworth, John Keats and PB Shelley. As a lover of nature and romantic poet, we find Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats in Devkota's poetic works. The way Devkota's Charu and Wordsworth's Lucy Gray appear similar in expression and theme, it is said that Devkota wrote Charu as a dedication to Wordsworth.</p>

<p>What spiritualism is to Lekhanath, nature is to Devkota. The theme of much of his works is nature and human sensitivity, feelings and love. In this way, Devkota is a master in romantic poetic work in Nepali literature. Although the romantic era in writing began during the period of Motiram Bhatta, it was still immature and imperfect. Devkota is the one who both professed and practiced and gave a new dimension to romantic poetic works in Nepal. While Motiram fantasised the romantic style with conservative tone, Devkota unified it with sense and reality. Devkota had a deep passion for nature and has perfectly practiced it through his aesthetic use of nature's image in his poetic works. He tries to instill beauty and fragrance of nature in his poems through his craft of words and sentences and eloquent expression.
    Recognizing his unprecedented contribution in the field of literature, he was honoured as a life member of the Nepal Academy, Devkota was also conferred with the title of Mahakabi (Poet the Great). He died at the age of 50 due to cancer in 2016 BS. With his demise Nepal lost a brilliant icon of Nepali literature.

<h2>Grammar</h2>
<h3>Relative clauses</h3>
<h3>A.	Study these examples</h3>

<p>The parts of the sentences in bold above are relative clauses. We use relative clauses to describe or give extra information about something we have already mentioned. We often use relative pronouns (e.g. who, where, that, which, whose) to introduce relative clauses.</p>
<p>In the first example who lives next door is defining relative clause. Defining relative clauses give us essential information: information that tells us who or what we are talking about.</p>
<p>In the second example 'which you can see on the roof there'. Non-defining relative clauses give us extra information which isn't absolutely necessary.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Down the Rabbit Hole</h2>
    <h2>Before you read</h2>
    <h3>a. Why do people have dreams?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Dreams are hallucinations that occur during certain stages of sleep. The brain is active
        all night long, with particularly intense brain activity in the forebrain and midbrain during rapid eye movement
        (REM) sleep. which is when we dream. The dreams represent our unconscious desires and wishes. They consolidate
        and process information gathered during the day. One widely held theory about the purpose of dreams is that they
        help you store important memories and things you've learned, get rid of unimportant memories, and sort through
        complicated thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Find any four other terms that refer to dreaming and explain their meanings. </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Reverie, fantasy, musing and nightmare are four other terms that refer to dreaming. Reverie
        means 'a state of thinking about pleasant things or daydreaming. Similarly, fantasy means a pleasant situation
        that you imagine but that is unlikely to happen. Musing refers to a period of thinking carefully about
        something, "Nightmare' is a dream that is very frightening.
    </p>
    <h3>c. What does 'down the rabbit hole' mean?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Down the rabbit hole' means 'a difficult state or situation conceived of as a hole into
        which one falls".</p>
    <p><strong>Now read the following extract from a novel, where Alice, dozing off as her sister reads to her, jumps
            down the rabbit hole falling for quite a while and landing in a mysterious hall.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or
        twice she had peeped into the book, her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and
        what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"<br><br>
        So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and
        stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
        daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.<br><br>
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the
        Rabbit say to itself "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
        to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the
        Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started
        to her feet, for it. flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat
        pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was
        just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.<br><br>
        In another moment Alice went after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.<br><br>
        The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that
        Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a
        very deep well.<br><br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter12_1.JPG">
        Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look
        about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was
        coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they
        were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung on pegs. She took
        down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed: it was labeled "ORANGE MARMALADE," but to her great
        disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so
        managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. "Well!" thought Alice to herself. "After such a
        fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down-stairs! How brave they'll all think of me at home! Why, I
        wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (Which was very likely true.) Down,
        down, down Would the fall never come to an end? "I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said
        aloud. "I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles
        down, I think..." (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room,
        and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
        her, still it was good practice to say it over) "...yes, that's about the right distance but then I wonder what
        Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" (Alice had not the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either,
        but she thought they were nice grand words to say.).<br><br>
        Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out
        among the people that walk with their heads downwards! The antipathies, I think" (she was rather glad there was
        no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) "...but I shall have to ask them what the
        name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand? Or Australia?" (and she tried to curtsey
        as she spoke fancy, curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) "And what
        an ignorant little girl she is. I think I am asking! No, it' I'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it
        written up somewhere.".<br><br>
        Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. "Dinah' Il miss me very much
        to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah,
        my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, 1 m afraid, but you might catch a bat,
        and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here Alice began to get rather
        sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way. "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" and
        sometimes "Do bats cat cats?", for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which
        way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand
        with Dinah, and was saying to her, very earnestly. "Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?",
        when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.<br><br>

        Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up onto her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark
        overhead: before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There
        was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a
        corner, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was close behind it when she turned the corner,
        but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
        lamps hanging from the roof.<br><br>
        There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side
        and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out
        again.<br><br>
        Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny
        golden key, and Alice's first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! Either
        the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on
        the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door
        about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it
        fitted!.<br><br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter12_2.JPG">
        Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt
        down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark
        hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get
        her head through the doorway; "and even if my head would go through," thought poor Alice, "it would be of very
        little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
        knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to
        think that very few things indeed were really impossible.<br><br>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter12_3.JPG">
        There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might
        find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she
        found a little bottle on it (which certainly was not here before," said Alice), and tied round the neck of the
        bottle was a paper label, with the words "DRINK ME" beautifully printed on it in large letters..<br><br>
        It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. "No, I'll
        look first," she said, "and see whether it's marked 'poison" or not"; for she had read several nice little
        stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because
        they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn
        you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and
        she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree
        with you, sooner or later..<br><br>
        However, this bottle was not marked "poison," so Alice ventured to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had,
        in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered
        toast), she very soon finished it off..<br><br>
        "What a curious feeling!" said Alice. "I must be shutting up like a telescope!".<br><br>
        And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was
        now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden, First, however, she waited for a
        few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; "for it might
        end, you know," said Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be
        like then?" And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out, for she
        could not remember ever having seen such a thing..<br><br>
        After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for
        poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back
        to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the
        glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she
        had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried..<br><br>
        "Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself rather sharply. "I advise you to leave this
        minute!" She generally gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she
        scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears
        for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very
        fond of pretending to be two people. “But it's no use now." thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two people!
        Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!".<br><br>
        Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very
        small cake, on which the words "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants, "Well, I' || eat it, said Alice,
        "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the
        door: so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!".<br><br>
        She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "Which way? Which way2 holding: her hand on the top of her
        head to feel which way it was growing: and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size. To
        be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting
        nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
        common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.<br>

    <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
    <h3>a. "Down the rabbit hole" is a sort of writing called fantasy. On the basis of your reading of the story point
        out some special elements of this kind of writing?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Fantasy is a genre of fiction. It includes characters and events that do not exist in real
        life. For instance, someone is not likely to encounter a wizard penguin in real life, "Alice's Adventures in
        Wonderland'', "Harry Potter'', "Charlie and Chocolate Factory" and "Lord of the Rings" are some of the examples
        of this genre. Most of the fantasies use magic or other supernatural elements in their plots.<br><br>
        Witches and wizards, fairies and elves, princes and princes, kings and queens, knights, dragons, talking
        animals, angels and devils, genomes, and unicom usually appear as the characters in these brands of literature.
        A fantasy is set in faraway lands and times, such as enchanted kingdoms or magical forests of medieval times. In
        "Down the Rabbit Hole', we can trace many of the above stated elements.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Is it good to imagine things which are not possible to achieve in reality? Explain.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Most people believe that imagination has nothing to do with reality. They don't relate it
        with success, achievement and reality. They consider it nonsensical and impractical. But I feel that imagination
        shapes the way which influences our hopes, actions and behaviours. Imagination is one of the most significant
        keys to success. A person's ambition, goal, plans and aims begins with the imagination and only later on turn
        into reality. Let us consider one example that backs up this claim. Thomas Edison dreamt of electric bulbs and
        made it happen. Various facts show that a successful person creates imaginary things in their mind and makes
        them real with suitable effort and steps. An obvious mental image of what one wants to achieve helps him to see
        his goal and the way towards it. He develops the qualities like willingness, enthusiasm, devotion and dedication
        to make things true.
    </p>
    <h3>c. Do you talk to yourself when you are in trouble? If yes, how does it help you?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Sometimes I talk to myself while undergoing a troublesome situation. It helps me in many
        ways. When I converse with myself, my brain works more efficiently. Moreover, it helps me organize ideas more
        effectively. Furthermore, it relieves my stress. I can think more transparently. As it fosters my confidence, I
        can solve any problem quite effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <h3>a. Narrate, in short, a folktale that you have read or heard.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Pied Piper of Hamelin </strong><br><br>
        Hamelin, a small town in Germany, was facing a big problem. Rats were running here, there, everywhere. The rats
        have made the lives of people miserable. So, the people of Hamelin went to meet the mayor. The mayor promised
        the people of Hamelin that he will take care of the problem. A Strange looking man with a funny looking hat
        carrying a long pipe walks to the mayor's office. The mayor asked the pied piper "Can you get rid of all the
        rats in Hamelin?" He said yes with great confidence. The mayor said that he will reward him with 1000 gold coins
        if he gets rid of all the rats in the town. A strange sound was heard by the people of Hamelin, Coming from the
        pipe of the strange man. To the people's surprise rats of all kinds, big, small, fat, and thin were all
        following the pied piper. As the pied piper walked, the rats kept following him. Finally, the pied piper reached
        the river and as he stood on the bank playing his pipe, the rats all jumped into the river and were swept away.
        The people were so happy. Soon, the pied piper came to see the mayor and asked for his reward. But the mayor
        refused to give his reward as he agreed. He gave only 100 gold coins as a reward. The pied piper was very angry
        and said: "you have cheated me, and you shall pay for it."<br><br>
        The next morning, a strange whistling sound was heard in Hamelin, and before the people could realize what was
        happening, all the children rushed out of their homes and started following the Pied piper far away from their
        town. The people of Hamelin rushed after the pied piper and the children, but they seemed to have just vanished!
        The people looked everywhere, but there was no sign of the children. Finally, they spotted a boy, who was lame,
        sitting by the roadside. He said he couldn't walk fast, so he was not able to follow the pied piper. Everybody
        asked him where the pied piper went. He said when the piper reached the mountain, it just seemed to open up, and
        everybody went inside. People went to the mayor and informed him. The mayor sent his men to search for the
        children but never again was they ever seen again. The homes in Hamelin wore a deserted and gloomy look. They
        were missing the laughter and cheer of the children. They were responsible for cheating Pied Piper and they
        shall live to regret this. It was a lesson for the people. never forgot.

    <h3>b. Describe a strange dream that you have seen recently.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; My strange dream</strong><br><br>
        I am going to tell you about my strange dream. Yesterday I went to bed and everything was calm. I fell asleep
        and, in a moment, I appeared in blackness. I called if someone could hear me but no one answered. I walked and
        walked until I saw a light. I went towards it and again I appeared in a forest with the bird singing and
        dancing. I listened to it, but then in a moment all went into flames. A voice screamed so loud that I fell down.
        I stood up and ran into the light. Again, and again, I appeared in a strange place. Now I was in a cup filled
        with coffee. I tried to get out but I couldn't. Then I appeared in the blackness again and I went into a green
        light. Suddenly I was in a bathtub filled with ducks. I scratched my head and asked myself how this was
        possible. Then I woke up. I was all sweaty and I laughed quietly to myself.

    <h3>Now, Read the following interview with Mr.Pun.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>You got a scholarship to study in the USA. After your education, why did you come back to Nepal and what
            plans had you made for Nepal then?</strong><br>
        I could have lived in the US if I had wanted to do so. I was a good student at the university and my professors
        liked me very much. It would not have been difficult for me to find a job there. However, I had found that life
        in the US was not easy either as many people think. People in developed countries like the US also have to work
        hard in order to make money for comfortable living, for raising their family and for maintaining their
        lifestyle. <br><br>Therefore, I decided to come to Nepal to visit my family and friends as soon as I graduated
        from the university. However, I did not have any plan and idea as what I could do in Nepal. I also did not have
        money to do anything. The only thing I had decided before I came to Nepal was not to apply for any job for
        living. I did not start any business either because I did not have money and idea. Therefore, I decided to stay
        in my home village Nangi of Myagdi district and to help villagers start a high school as a volunteer teacher.
        That was the beginning of my lifelong journey in Nepal. <br><br>
        <strong>But those who go abroad for their higher education rarely return after their education? What made you
            think to come back and do something for the country?</strong><br>
        Yes, many people rarely return after they get their education in the US and in other developed countries. It is
        their choice. The main reason they do not return is that they know there are almost no job opportunities in
        Nepal to make money for living. Therefore, they decide to stay abroad and find job. However, I wanted not to
        work for people or for a company in the US or in Nepal to have "so called" better living. To enjoy in my life, I
        wanted to work independently and do something on my own for the benefits of human beings. Therefore, I made my
        decision to come to Nepal and stay in mountain villages. I could not have done what I have been able to do in
        Nepal if I had decided to find a job either in the US or in Nepal. After I started living in the mountain
        village and working with the communities, I found that life in the mountain villages was more comfortable for me
        because I was free to do anything I wanted to try. Therefore. I decided to live in Nepal all my life. I am very
        glad that I decided to come and stay in Nepal rather than staying in the US.<br><br>
        <strong>What motivated you to involve in innovation?</strong><br>
        The necessity to gain something in life makes people innovators. It was after I started living in the mountain
        villages, I found many problems in the communities, and my mind. started to think about finding solution for
        those problems. As a result, I started doing lots of brainstorming by myself and with the communities to find
        ways to start and run viable projects for community development. My experience tells that you should be
        innovative. especially when you want to find solution for a problem. For example, I had to be innovative to
        start income generating projects such as paper making, jam making, cheese making, etc. which nobody in that area
        had tried before. I also had to be innovative to start wireless networking project to bring the Internet because
        I did not have ideas and money. The same thing is happening with National Innovation Centre that was started
        without any idea and money. To make it short, I can tell that it is the necessity of the communities to start
        different development projects and that it is the necessity to retain the most talented and innovative young
        people in Nepal for economic development that motivated me to be involved in innovation.<br><br>
        <strong>Where did you start doing such an entrepreneurship and what have you done up to now?</strong><br>
        I started it from my village Nangi of Myagdi district. It took a few years for me to learn about the situation
        of other mountain communities and to get acquainted with them.<br><br>I started to work as a volunteer in my
        village and I really did not know how long I could stay in the village. Step by step, I got involved in the
        field of education to help improve the quality of education in rural schools by helping to build schools and
        introducing computers and the Internet. I helped to set up community clinics the villages where there were no
        health posts in order to help people to get basic health services. Later I connected the clinics to hospital in
        1 1 in Pokhara and Kathmandu through the Internet for telemedicine. I worked with the community leaders. start
        as many income generation programmes as possible to help people to make some money and create job opportunities.
        Some of the income generating programmes that I helped to start are Yak farming, camping ground for the
        trekkers, cheese making, jam making, paper making, bee keeping. vegetable farming, handicraft making, fish
        farming etc. I started community based wireless networking programme to bring computers and the Internet in the
        remote mountain villages. I helped to start community owned and managed ecotourism programmes by starting five
        day and twelve day trekking trails with lodges and other facilities for the trekkers. Those projects are running
        well. Now I am working for the establishment of Rashtriya Awishkar Kendra (National Innovation Centre), which
        has kept me very busy because many young people with innovative and creative ideas come to the centre to present
        their ideas and to do research and development work. Working with them has become my everyday routine now. Now I
        am travelling all over Nepal to give information about the innovation centre we have started and to encourage
        young people to be innovative. <br><br>
        <strong>When was National Innovation Centre established and what is its main goal?</strong><br>
        National Innovation Centre (NIC) is a non-profit-making organisation established on 9. December 2012, and
        started fundraising campaign and some research works from 2016. The centre was built at the premise of Research
        Centre for Applied Science and Technology, Tribhuvan University Kirtipur, Kathmandu and was formally inaugurated
        on 18 October 2019.<br><br>The main goal of the National Innovation Centre is to retain talented, innovative and
        creative young people and use their talents for the economic development of Nepal, specifically through research
        and innovation. I thought about starting the centre because after working for 25 years in the villages, I
        realized the most important step needs to take in order become economically prosperous country to keep the
        talented and innovative human capitals in the country and help them become entrepreneurs. All the de cloped
        countries have always taken that step, which Nepal must take if we want to become prosperous. That is why
        decided to establish innovation centre. Also the ultimate goal of NIC is to help reduce the trade deficit of
        Nepal by helping innovative people to create and develop products that are being imported from abroad. It is
        very necessary because we are importing more than 92% of goods and exporting less than 8%. that has created a
        huge trade deficit. <br><br>
        <strong>Whose support are you getting to enhance your campaign?</strong><br>
        I did not seek funding from the government and donors to start project. For doing all the works that I have done
        so far, the main support has been coming from people and communities. It is because people have found that the
        projects that I have started are very beneficial for the communities and for the nation. For example, most of
        the money for the wireless networking project came from communities because they found that Internet is very
        useful for them. For the eco-trekking and income generating programmes, the money is coming from communities.
        Even for the establishment of NIC, almost all of the support is coming from Nepalese people. Therefore, I can
        tell that my campaign is funded and managed by people for the benefit of people. <br><br>
        <strong>How do you think that it would help in developing our country?</strong><br>
        Nobody should forget the fact that innovation is the engine to drive the economic development. Without giving
        topmost priority for research and innovation and without investing huge amount of money for nurturing its
        innovative citizen, no country in the world has become economically prosperous. The developed countries like the
        US, the UK, Germany, Japan, Israel and others have become prosperous because they have always given research and
        innovation the topmost priority for economic development and they are investing huge amount of money for that.
        However, Nepal, so far, is not investing any money or too little money for research and innovation. Besides, we
        do not have culture of innovation that encourages young people to be innovative and creative. Keeping these
        facts in mind, innovation centre was established. The innovation centre is providing a well-equipped platform in
        its capacity and full support system to the innovators to do research and development. Our innovators are trying
        to develop different types of products or services that can be commercialized in the market. That way they would
        ultimately become entrepreneurs and help for the economic development of Nepal.<br><br>
        <strong>What do you want to suggest to youths who are going abroad and living there forgetting their
            country?</strong><br>
        Going abroad in search of better education and job opportunities is something we can't stop or should not stop
        unless and until we create good opportunities and environment for the talented youths to stay and work in Nepal.
        Besides, it is human nature to explore for new opportunities in foreign soils. It is not entirely their fault to
        go abroad. It is our responsibility to create sound environment and support system to keep the most talented and
        innovative people and use them for the economic development of Nepal. My suggestion and request to those youths,
        who are going abroad, is not to forget our motherland and help Nepal by bringing back innovative ideas that can
        help to create the economy of our country and help Nepal become a prosperous nation.<br><br>
        <strong>Lastly, do you have to say anything about your plan and vision?</strong><br>
        I would like to encourage young students to think about becoming innovators and entrepreneurs by coming up with
        innovative ideas and by being involved in research and innovation activities while they are still attending
        schools. They should not wait to become innovative and entrepreneurs until they graduate from the schools or
        colleges. Also I would like to tell that work of building innovation centres and nurturing our talented and
        innovative people is something we, the people of Nepal, can do by ourselves. I would like to request the federal
        government, state government, and local government of Nepal to set aside a small percentage of their development
        budget for setting up innovation centres in order to capture and utilize the innovative human capitals for the
        economic development of Nepal.<br><br>
        <strong>Thank you for your time and best of luck in the work you have begun.</strong><br>
        As always, it is my pleasure to encourage young minds and work with them. With the support from the innovative
        young people, we will certainly be able to make Nepal a prosperous nation. There is no doubt in it.<br><br>

    </p>
    <h2>Critical Thinking</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a. Pun says, "We do not have culture of innovation that encourages young people to be innovative and
            creative. Do you agree with him? Explain.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Encouraging invention, research, and creativity in young people is essential to the
        development of any country. Education is the glorious means with the formidable mission of preparing today's
        youth for tomorrow's society. But in our country. educational institutions don't necessarily quip the young
        graduates with a culture of innovation. The majority of the Nepalese youths leave studying at a premature stage
        since they don't see a sound environment and future in their education system. <br><br>Some youths who continue
        their study go abroad in search of better opportunities. The young population should receive maximum
        encouragement for their inventive and creative capacity. It is essential to identify those ways and means of
        promoting conditions favourable to the development of potentially innovative talents. Educational institutions,
        government, vocational schools, and educated citizenry should create the environment to encourage invention and
        research. By developing the sense of responsibility, strengthening the spirit of initiative, encouraging the
        critical attitude we can make them involve in innovative project. If they can find suitable platform, and
        guarantee of handsome income, they will get motivated to stay back in Nepal and do research and invention. It is
        our responsibility to create sound environment and support system to keep the most talented and innovative
        people and use them for the economic development of Nepal.<br><br>

                Hi Samia, <br>
                Just a quick email to say that sounds like a great idea. Saturday is better for me because I'm meeting
                my parents on Sunday. So if that's still good for you, why don't you come here? Then you can see the new
                flat and all the work we've done on the kitchen since we moved in. We can eat at home and then go for a
                walk in the afternoon. It's going to be so good to catch up finally I want to hear all about your new
                job! <br><br>
                Our address is 52 Charles Road, but it's a bit difficult to find because the house numbers are really
                strange here. If you turn left at the post office and keep going past the big white house on Charles
                Road, there's a small side street behind it with the houses 50-56 in. Don't ask me why the side street
                doesn't have a different name! But call me if you get lost and I'll come and get you. Let me know if
                there's anything you do/don't like to eat. <br> Really looking forward to seeing you! <br>
                See you soon! <br>

                    I think I have had a very interesting life. I'm 73 now and I don't work anymore. I was in the army
                    for 31 years. I retired when I was 52. I have been to so many. countries that I can't remember all
                    of them. I've been to Australia six or seven times and to South Africa three times. I have also been
                    once to Russia but I didn't like it at all: much too cold for me! <br><br>
                    I've never been on television, but I've been on the radio once. It was a programme - about life in
                    the military about twenty years ago. I've met a lot of famous people: members of the royal family,
                    famous politicians and also famous cinema and television personalities. I've never met the American
                    President though which is a pity. <br><br>
                    Because I've travelled a lot, I've seen a lot of wonderful things and have also eaten and drunk some
                    strange foods and drinks. I ate cat and rat in India. drank something called Mirto on a little
                    island in Italy many years ago.

<p><strong>Now, read the following article about the power of Napoleon in politics.</strong></p>

<p>Many portraits of Napoleon show him with his right hand placed inside his coat or shirt. In fact, there was nothing wrong with Napoleon's hand. At the time, portrait painters thought this pose made men look more dignified. Also, they had one less hand to draw and paint. Looking at his portraits, we can tell that Napoleon was an important person.</p>

<p>But who was this man?</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769 on the French island of Corsica, not far from the coast of Italy. He was one of fourteen children. As a boy, Napoleon loved to play soldiers with his brothers. When he was old enough, his parents sent him to military school to learn how to become a real soldier. After he completed his training at the military school. Napoleon became an officer in the French army.</p>

<p>Four years later, in 1789, there was a sudden and violent change in France. Tired of paying heavy taxes so the king and his nobles could live in luxury, poor and middleclass people started a revolution. They executed the king and queen and many of their royal friends and then declared France a republic where all people were to pay taxes according to their wealth.</p>

<p>When the rulers of other European countries heard what happened in France, they thought they, too, would lose control over their countries. Austria and Britain went to war with the new republic of France. Napoleon was a brilliant officer and was only twenty-seven years old when he was made Commander-in-Chief of the French army in Italy. He won one victory after another, defeating the Austrians in eighteen battles. Then he moved his army to Egypt to stop the British trade route to India He won a victory over the Egyptians in 1798 at the Battle of the Pyramids. In 1799, his troops in Egypt discovered the Rosetta Stone, an important object which helped people to understand ancient Egyptian writing for the first time. Napoleon had with him scholars from many fields who wanted to set up schools in Egypt. One group of scholars studied the pyramids and started the science of Egyptology. However, the British destroyed Napoleon's ships and he lost the Rosetta stone to them. Then Napoleon decided to return to France.</p>

<p>When Napoleon returned to France, he was appointed first consul. The French needed at strong ruler at this time, and Napoleon was one. He became consul for life in 1802, and int 1804, Napoleon declared himself emperor of France. The Pope came from Rome to perform the ceremony. Napoleon, richly dressed, listened to the service. Then Napoleon took the crown before the Pope could take it, and he pu. it on his own head. He did this to show that he got the crown because of his wisdom and military skill; he was not simply given the honour by the Pope.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, Napoleon made himself master of almost all of Europe. He conquered Austria in 1805 and Prussia in 1806. Then he formed an alliance with Russia, and he made one of his brothers the king of Spain and another brother king of Holland.</p>

<p>In France, he ruled wisely and well, and he restored law and order after the revolution. He reorganized the French government and the Bank of France. He built many fine roads and improved the old ones. He turned Paris into a beautiful city with wide streets, fine bridges, and beautiful buildings and monuments, such as the Arc de Triomphe. More important still, he improved the laws. To this day, his Napoleonic Code is the foundation of European law, as well as of laws in Central and South America and Quebec in Canada. Napoleon wrote the Code's original 2,281 articles himself, although he was completely self-taught in legal matters. The Code created a legal system in which all citizens were equal. It was so clearly written that it could be read and understood by ordinary people at a time when all laws were written in Latin and understood by only a few.</p>

<p>Napoleon was a genius as an army commander. He conquered the huge Austrian Empire. and ruled Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. He had the largest empire seen in Europe since the days of the ancient Romans. The only country he could not defeat was Britain, losing to the British in 1805 in the Battle of Trafalgar. Then, in 1812, Napoleon made his biggest mistake by invading Russia. He entered Moscow, but he found that nearly all the people had left. There were fires all over the city, and most of it was destroyed. With no place to house his soldiers and no food for them to eat in the bitter Russian winter, Napoleon had no choice but to retreat. Napoleon lost half a million men in Russia. When he was finally defeated, he was sent to the island of Elba in the Mediterranean. By 1814. one million Frenchmen were dead. Napoleon was humiliated.</p>

<P>After ten months in Elba, Napoleon escaped, went back to France, and declared himself emperor again. He ruled for 100 days. In the meantime, the Europeans gathered their armies to end his rule. The combined armies, led by the British Duke of Wellington, defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. After this, he was sent to the island of St. Helena in the Atlantic Ocean, where he died six years later at age fifty-two. We do not know what Napoleon died of exactly. Some doctors argued that he died of cancer; others say he was poisoned.</P>

<p>Napoleon was a military genius and had a brilliant mind. He fought many wars and thought there would not be peace in Europe until the continent was under one ruler - himself. Perhaps Napoleon would have an even greater ruler had he not been driven by his love of power.

<h3>h.	How could Napoleon have been an even greater ruler?</h3>

<h2>Critical thinking</h2>
<h3>a.	What can be the qualities of a great leader? Can a great leader remain in
    power for long in a country? Discuss.
    </h3>
<p>Ans.	John Calvin Maxwell, an American author, speaker, and pastor, once famously remarked: "A leader knows the way, goes the way and shows the way". In a brief statement, Mr. Maxwell has given a voluminous description of an adept leader. A good leader creates an inspiring vision of the failure and motivates, inspires people to engage with that vision. He manages delivery of the vision as well as coaches. and builds a team so that it is more effective to achieve the vision. He must have vision and ability to convert that vision to others. H will be able to think critically about the organization, team work and understand the strengths and weakness and correction time.
    If a leader does not get driven by his love of power, he can remain in power for a long time. He should be humble to his people. He must be engrossed in the service of the subjects of his care. He should not be ruled by arrogance, greed and impatience.
    </p>
<h3>b.	The 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people for the people and by the people. Do you think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal? Explain. </h3>
<p>Ans.	Democracy was rightfully defined as a rule of the people for the people by the people', by a popular freedom fighter, Abraham Lincoln. I don't think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal. One can argue that this country is now at democratic republic. However, all democracies may not have been properly. upholding Mr. Lincoln's view. In my view, assurance of some basic democratic principles is a must to maintain people's rule. Recognition of the fundamental dignity of every person is the first requirement. Similarly, respecting for the equality of all persons is another characteristic of a democratic culture, which will be joined by civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, expression, etc., and rule of law.
    But in the Nepalese context, fundamental rights of the commoners have been massively ignored. Civil liberties are manipulated according to the will of the leaders and the power holders. Majority group suppresses the minority one. Class and caste division is still in practice. Social injustice, inequality, unemployment and political instability regularly invades Nepal amidst the endless conflicts between the ruler party and the opposition parties. Nepalese version of democracy then goes like this: 'Democracy is the rule of the leader by the leader for the leader.'
    </p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3>a.	Write an essay on Power and Politics in about 500 words.</h3>
<p>Ans.	Politics and power are interrelated concepts. Where there is politics there is power. We can put it this way, politics is an activity related to power. The former is the possession and the distribution of power. It is often said that political power is the greatest power of all.</p>

<p>Power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get what you want. It is frequently defined as the ability to influence the behavior of others with or without resistance. It is often visible to others within organizations (for instance, politics). It has both positive and negative consequences. It can be intoxicating and equally devastating when abused. It may derive from a number of sources, including social class (material wealth can equal power), resource currency (material items such as money, property, food), personal or group charisma, ascribed power (acting on perceived or assumed abilities, whether these bear testing or not), social influence. of tradition (compare ascribed power), etc.</p>

<p>In simple words, politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions. Moreover, it is about making agreements between people so that they can live. together in groups such as tribes, cities, or countries. In this regard, politics is at the heart of all collective social activities that involve collaborative decisions. It is the interest of both individuals and groups.</p>

<p>Politics is usually applied to behaviour within civil governments, but it can be observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. We will focus primarily on political power in this essay. Some define politics quite simply as the exercise of power. It often involves the distribution of resources or decisions on who gets what". It can be seen as a game in which actors try to influence each other to get others to do what they. would not otherwise have done. However, it can also include less observable ways of exercising power such as the setting of agendas - be it parliamentary agendas that determine who gets to speak, for how long and on what issues, or news agendas that determine which issues are newsworthy and will appear on the evening news, and which issues will not make the cut.</p>

<h3>b.	Write a couple of paragraphs about a national hero who fought bravely in the Anglo-Nepal War.</h3>

<p>Ans.	Bhakti Thapa was a brave soldier. When we talk about the Anglo-Nepal War, we cannot skip the reference of this heroic man. Just two years later after the unification of Jumla, he was made the supreme commander (Sardar) of the Nepalese army and stationed to the west of capital in the region that stretched almost up to the Sutlej River. He was the patriot involved in the Anglo-Nepal war. His most important contribution in the war was at the western front of Deothal.</p>
<p>In the Anglo-Nepal war, sardar Bhakti Thapa was controlling operation of the whole western region of Nepal from the fort of Malaun. As the British forces had controlled over the fort of Deuthal 1,000 m away from Malaun fort the whole of the western region was stake, which made sardar Bhakti Thapa go to the battle field taking naked Khukuri and sword on his hand along with 2,000 Nepalese Solders. amidst the fierce gun firing of the British Army on April 16, 1815. There was fiere fighting between the two forces killing 100 soldiers of the Nepalese army while all the officers were killed except only one arsenal. In this battle when sardar Bhakti Thapa tried to capture British cannon, he was hit by the bullet at his heart. The major David Octorlony, handed over very respectfully to the Nepalese army.</p>
<P>The dead body of Bhakti Thapa after covering it with Dosalla (Woolen shawl) The very next day, his body was cremated with due state guard of honour. His two wives committed sati. Before going to the battle field. He had handed over his son Buda Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. Sitting at the foot of the flag of Nepal. Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa and Ram Das, the son of Bhakti Thapa encouraged the Nepalese army looking around the sight of war. The anglo Nepal was took a different turn after. He end of this battle. The way sardar Bhakti Thapa laid down his life at the Deothal battle has become a legend in Nepalese history.</P>
<p>Bhakti Thapa, then 74. led a daring counterattack against the British force entrenched at Deothal. He had played a significant role to keep Nepal alive.</p>

    <h2>Before you read</h2>
    <h3>a. What is war?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>War can mean many things to many people. It usually refers to conflict, battle, dispute,
        disagreement, violence, and disorder between or among people, communities or nations.
    </p>
    <h3>b. What happens if there is war in the country? Describe its consequences.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The people will be deprived of peace and quiet if there is a war in a country. It curses
        the country with death, injury, sexual violence, malnutrition, illness, and disability.
    </p>
    <h3>c. Describe a devastating war in world history.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The Second World War is one of the most devastating wars in world history. It lasted for
        almost six years (1939-1845). It brought upon deaths of 3% of the world population, out of which 39 million
        people were from Europe alone. It also resulted in widespread destruction of homes and physical capital.
    </p>
    <h3>Now read the following essay about war in the hope of peace.</h3>
    <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/11English_chapter15_1.JPG">
        Only recently, Wilson and Lloyd George proclaimed their unswerving will to fight on till final victory. Int the
        Italian Chamber the Socialist Mergari was treated like a madman because he had spoken a few natural, human
        words. And today, with what wooden self righteousness a Wolff dispatch denies the rumour of a new German peace
        proposal: "Germany and its allies have not the slightest reason for repeating their magnanimous offer of
        peace."<br><br>
        In other words, everything goes on as before, and if anywhere a peaceful blade of grass tries to pierce the
        ground, a military boot is quick to trample it.<br><br>
        Yet at the same time, we read that peace negotiations have begun in Brest-Litovsk, that Herr Kühlmann has opened
        the session with a reference to the significance of Christmas and has spoken, in the words of the Gospel, of
        peace on earth. If he means what he says, if he has even the faintest understanding of those tremendous words,
        peace is inevitable. Unfortunately, our experience of Bible quotations in the mouths of statesmen has not thus
        far been encouraging.<br><br>
        For many days now, the eyes of the world have been focused upon two places. In those two places, it is widely
        felt, the destinies of nations are coming to a head, the future beckoning, and disaster threatening. With bated
        breath the world is looking eastward, to the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk. And at the same time it is
        watching the western front in dire anguish, for everyone feels, everyone knows that, short of a miracle, the
        most dreadful disaster that has ever befallen men is there impending: the bitterest, bloodiest, most ruthless
        and appalling battle of all time.<br><br>
        Everyone knows it and everyone, with the exception of a few sanguine political orators and war profiteers, is
        trembling at the thought. Concerning the outcome of this mass slaughter, opinions and hopes vary. In both camps,
        there is a minority who seriously believe in a decisive victory. But one thing that no one endowed with a
        vestige of good sense can believe is that the ideal, humanitarian aims, which figure so prominently in the
        speeches of all our statesmen, will be achieved. The bigger, the bloodier, the more destructive these final
        battles of the World War prove to be, the less will be accomplished for the future, the less hope there will be
        of appeasing hatreds and rivalries, or of doing away with the idea that political aims can be attained by the
        criminal instrumentality of war. If one camp should indeed achieve final victory (and this purpose is the one
        justification offered by the leaders in their incendiary speeches), then what we abhor as "militarism" will have
        won out. If in their secret heart the partisans of war mean so much as a single word of what they have been
        saying about war aims, absurdity, the utter futility of all their arguments staggers the imagination.<br><br>
        Can a new massacre of inconceivable scope be justified by such a jumble of hopeless fallacies, of mutually
        contradictory hopes and plans? While all people with even the slightest experience of war and its suffering are
        awaiting the outcome of the Russian peace negotiations in prayer and expectation, while all of us are moved to
        love and gratitude for the Russians because they, first among nations, have attacked the war at its root and
        resolved to end it, while half the world is going hungry and useful human effort has been halved where it has
        not ceased altogether at such a time, preparations are being made in France for what we shudder even to name, a
        mass slaughter which is expected to decide, but will not decide, the outcome of the war, for the final senseless
        mustering of heroism and patience, the final hideous triumph of dynamite and machines over human life and the
        human spirit!<br><br>
        In view of this situation, it is our duty, the one sacred duty of every man of good will on earth, not to
        sheathe ourselves in indifference and let things take their course, but to do our utmost to prevent this final
        catastrophe,
        Yes, you say, but what can we do? If we were statesmen and ministers, we would do our bit, but, as it is, we
        have no power!<br><br>
        This is the easy reaction to all responsibility until it becomes too pressing. If we turn to the politicians and
        leaders, they too shake their heads and invoke their helplessness. We cannot sit back and put the blame on
        them.<br><br>
        To blame are the inertia and cowardice of each one of us, our obstinacy and reluctance to think. In response to
        the excellent Mergari, Sonnino refused to say "anything that might give aid and comfort to the enemy"; the Wolff
        dispatch I have just mentioned declares that Germany has "not the slightest reason" to make another move in
        behalf of peace. But every day we ourselves give evidence of the same attitude. We accept things as they come,
        we rejoice in victories, we deplore the losses in our own camp, we tacitly accept war as an instrument of
        politics.<br><br>
        Alas, every nation and every family, every single individual in all Europe and far beyond it, has more than
        enough "reason" to give his utmost in behalf of the peace for which we all yearn. Only a vanishing minority of
        men truly want the war to go on and beyond a doubt they deserve our contempt and sincerest hatred. No one else,
        only a very few morbid fanatics or unscrupulous criminals are in favour of this war, and yet inconceivable as it
        seems-it goes on and on, with both sides arming indefatigably for the allegedly final holocaust in the
        West!<br><br>
        This is possible only because we are all too lazy, too easygoing, too cowardly. It is possible only because
        somewhere in our secret hearts we approve or tolerate the war, because we throw all the resources of our minds
        and souls to the winds and let the misguided machines roll on! That is what the political leaders do, and what
        the armies do, but we ourselves, the onlookers, are no better. We all know that we can stop the war if we want
        to in earnest. We know that whenever men have felt an action to be truly necessary they have performed it
        against all resistance. We have looked on with admiration and beating hearts as the Russians laid down their
        arms and manifested their will to make peace. There is no person on earth that has not been profoundly moved in
        its heart and conscience by this marvelous drama. But at the same moment we reject the obligations such feelings
        imply. Every politician in the world is all in favour of revolution, reason. and the laying down of arms-but
        only in the enemy camp, not in his own! If we are in earnest, we can stop the war. Once again the Russians have
        exemplified the ancient and holy doctrine that the weak can be mightiest. Why does no one follow them? Why do
        parliaments and cabinets everywhere content themselves with the same dreary drivel, the same day-to-day
        trivialities, why do they nowhere rise up to champion a great idea, the only idea that matters today? Why do
        they favour the self determination of nations only when they themselves hope to profit? Why are people still
        taken in by the false idealism of official phrasemongers? It has been said that every nation has the rulers it
        wants and deserves. Maybe so. We Europeans at all events have the bloodiest and most ruthless of all rulers:
        war. Is that what we want and deserve?<br><br>
        No, we don't want it. We all want the opposite. Apart from a small number of profiteers, no one wants this
        shameful and dismal state of affairs. What then can we do? We can't best ourselves! We can take every
        opportunity to manifest our readiness for peace. We can desist from such useless provocations as the
        above-mentioned Wolff dispatch, and stop talking like Sonnino. At the present juncture a slight humiliation, a
        concession, a humane impulse can do us no harm! How, when we have befouled ourselves so thoroughly with blood,
        can we worry about petty national vanities?<br><br>
        Now is the time to oust those statesmen who conceive foreign policy in terms of self seeking national
        programmes, who ignore the cry of mankind! Why wait until their stupidity has shed the blood of more
        millions?<br><br>
        All of us great and small, belligerents and neutrals we must not close our ears to the dire warning of this
        hour, the threat of such unthinkable horrors. Peace is at hand! As a thought, a desire, a suggestion, as a power
        working in silence, it is everywhere, in every heart. If each one of us opens his heart to it, if each one of us
        firmly resolves to serve the cause of peace, to communicate his thoughts and intimations of peace- if every man
        of good will decides to devote himself exclusively for a little while to clearing away the obstacles, the
        barriers to peace, then we shall have peace.<br><br>
        If that is done we shall all have helped to bring it about, we shall all feel worthy of the great tasks it will
        impose-whereas hitherto we have all been possessed by a feeling of shared guilt.<br><br>

    <h2>Comprehension</h2>
    <h2>Answer question</h2>
    <h3>a. Why was the Italian Socialist Mergari treated like a madman?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Italian socialist Mergari was treated like a madman because he had spoken a few natural
        human words.</p>
    <h3>b. Can political aims be attained by the criminal instrumentality of war? If yes, how?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Yes, political aims can be attained by criminal instrumentality of war. The politicians are
        war profiteers. They are only concerned with the outcome of mass slaughter. They use criminal instrumentality of
        war to achieve power and gain. According to the writer, the bigger, the bloodier, the more destructive the
        battles. the less will be accomplished for the future, the less hope there will be of appeasing hatreds and
        rivalries.
    </p>
    <h3>c. Which hopes and plans were said to be mutually contradictory?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The hopes and plans related to war, mass slaughter and suppression of people for the sake
        of humanity, peace and prosperity were said to be mutually contradictory.
    </p>
    <h3>d. What can be the sacred duty of every man of good will on earth?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The sacred duty of every man of good will on earth can be to prevent the final catastrophe
        (war).</p>
    <h3>e. Is it good to tacitly accept war as an instrument of politics? If not, what else should be done?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>No, it is not good to tacitly accept was as an instrument of politics. Politicians should
        not engage in war, rather they should accept things as they come, rejoice in victories and should deplore the
        losses in their own camp. Moreover, we must not close our cars to the dire warning of this hour, the threat of
        such unthinkable horrors.
    </p>
    <h3>f. How can we stop war in the world?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>If each one of us opens his heart to it, if each one of us firmly resolves to serve the
        cause of peace, to communicate his thoughts and intimations of peace if every man of good will decides to devote
        himself exclusively for a little while to clearing away the obstacles, the barriers to peace, then we can stop
        war in the world.
    </p>
    <h3>g. What is the main message of this essay?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The main message of this story is that we have to establish and keep peace in the world by
        stopping wars.</p>
    <h2>Critical thinking</h2>
    <h3>a. Are warmongers the greatest enemies for peace? What do you want to suggest to them?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>A warmonger is a strong supporter of war. Moreover, he advocates or stirs up war. He can
        appear to promote peace in some activities but still be a warmonger at heart. The Warmongers apply a false and
        unreal ideology to break the harmony and peace of the country. They want to seize property, land and treasures
        by creating hatred among groups and compelling them to be involved in war. They are the reasons for the loss of
        peace in the world. I want to suggest that they engage in creative discussions to reach an agreement rather than
        choosing the path of violence.
    </p>
    <h3>b. The Nobel Prize Winner American novelist John Steinbeck (1902-1968) once said, "All war is a symptom of man's
        failure as a thinking animal". Do you agree with the novelist? Why?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>I agree with the novelist. War is the worst thing in the world. It gives benefit to none.
        It causes immense loss of human life and resources on part of both the winning country as well as the losing
        country. When we forget reasoning and humanity and instead follow animal instincts, we fail to use the advantage
        we have as a thinking creature.</p>
    <h3>c. Does any war end all wars and bring lasting peace to the world? Discuss.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The one-word answer for this is no. Not a single war can bring about lasting peace by
        ending other wars. Instead, it creates a new kind of war among people. The new. war gives rise to new enemies
        and fresh personal grudges. Peace is the solution to war not another war.
    </p>
    <h3>d. Why do you think countries go in wars even though they have their own boundaries?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>It is because war doesn't respect political or territorial boundaries. But there is a
        policy gap across borders where statehood and diplomacy can struggle to reach. A country doesn't respect the
        other's sovereignty, independence and dignity, which creates a feeling of animosity among people. Some big
        countries are power hungry. Their greed and lust for dominance is also responsible for them to go into wars.

    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <h3>Write essays in about 500 words on the following topics.</h3>
    <p><strong>a. War and peace</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans: </strong>War is a terrible evil. It refers to an armed battle between nations. War causes big
        sufferings to the family members of the people who die during the war. During wars, there is massive destruction
        of property, wealth, trade, industry, etc. It completely upsets the social life of people.<br><br>
        Many people argue that war is a necessary evil, and the only process of solving international disputes. But, in
        reality, war happens, only because people are not ready to settle disputes in a peaceful manner.<br><br>
        Peace means complete freedom from disturbance. It refers to those times when there is no war or fight among
        nations. Once the world starts believing that wars are unnecessary and decide to abolish war completely, they
        will certainly find a way for peaceful co-existence.<br><br>
        Human being's love for peace is universal. Human beings are by nature peaceful. War does not furnish a proof of
        the idea that humans are fighting animals. Even the acts of war did not spoil the least human's spontaneous love
        for peace.<br><br>
        Modern people are threatened by the dreadful inventions of science. But this actual threat is coming not from
        science but from war, in which the power of science is abused. It is one thing to keep a nation strong and
        vigorous and save it, it is another thing to infuse a wanton spirit of aggression and destruction into
        it.<br><br>
        The modern nations must truly realize in their heart the full significance of the teaching- 'For all they that
        take to the sword, shall perish with the sword'. Then and then only shall peace reign in the world.

    </p>
    <p><strong>b. Responsive youths for peace and prosperity</strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans: </strong>Youths are the pillars of peace and tranquility in the world. The threat of nuclear power
        has been killing our peace of mind, happiness and our wish to live. It has affected man's life directly or
        indirectly. Even slight misuse of atomic energy may bring about horrible changes in climate, biological
        structure, ecological system and finally annihilate the world.<br><br>
        Let the youths make a special request for providing advice, help with setting up courses and conferences on
        world peace to assist in workshops and peace education for the youth. Youth must be encouraged to appeal to the
        world leader to create a peaceful and sustainable world. The exercise of human rights and freedom is an
        essential element of peace. Peace is an essential requirement for the satisfaction of human basic needs such as
        food, shelter, health, education, security, labour and environment.<br><br>
        We know that there are a large number of youths missing the proper training and education for good productive
        jobs, very few jobs and too many non-productive employment with poor payment and security the country can't
        obtain prosperity. The world community should invest much money in applicable skills, trainings. suited to the
        job market should provide them.<br><br>
        Growing awareness of the interdependence of the world and of global problems is of concern to all people of the
        world. Without a creative and innovative mind, we can't achieve prosperity. So, every nation should create an
        environment of creative tasks and research for the benefit of human beings.

    <h4>"What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies." <br> (साथी भनेको के हो ? एउटा आत्मा दुई शरीरमा बास गर्नु हो ।) <br> -Aristotle </h4>
    <h2>What is the Soul?</h2>
    <h2>Before you read</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	Which one do you think is primary: body or soul? Why?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I think body is primary part as it is all what we can see and make physical observation as soul is something which we cannot see. Soul has no value without a body whereas a body without soul is a questionable thing. <br><br>
        <strong>b. 	"A circle has beginning"? Do agree or disagree with the statement? Explain. </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I don't agree because if there is no beginning place, space or point, it is impossible to form any circle. To appear in a physical matter we need primary source and starting part. Without time and space we don't see the physical matter. <br>

    <h3>Now read the following essay about the existence of the soul in the materialist world.</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most painful circumstances of recent advances in science is that each one makes us know less than we thought we did. When I was young we all knew, or thought we knew, that a man consists of a soul and a body, that the body is in time and space, but the soul is in time only. Whether the soul survives death was a matter as to which opinions might differ, but that there is a soul was thought to be indubitable. As for the body, the plain man of course considered its existence self-evident, and so did the man of science, but the philosopher was apt to analyse it away after one fashion or another, reducing it usually to ideas in the mind of the man who had the body and anybody else t who happened to notice him. The philosopher, however, was not taken seriously, and science remained comfortably materialistic, even in the hands of quite orthodox scientists. <br><br>
        Nowadays these fine old simplicities are lost: physicists assure us that there is no such thing as matter, and psychologists assure us that there is no such thing as mind. This is an unprecedented occurrence. Who ever heard of a cobbler saying that there was no such thing as boots, or a tailor maintaining that all men are really naked? Yet that would have been no odder than what physicists and certain psychologists have been doing. To begin with the latter, some of them attempt to reduce everything that seems to be mental activity to an activity of the body. There are, however, various difficulties in the way of cing mental activity to physical activity. I do not think we can yet say with any assurance whether these difficulties are or are not insuperable. What we can say, on the basis of physics itself, is that what we have hitherto called our body is really an elaborate scientific construction not corresponding to any physical reality. <br><br>
        The modern would-be materialist thus finds himself in a curious position, for, while he may with a certain degree of success reduce the activities of the mind to those of the body, he cannot explain away the fact that the body itself is merely a convenient concept invented by the mind. We find ourselves thus going round and round in a circle: mind is an emanation of body, and body is an invention of mind. Evidently this cannot be quite right, and we have to look for something that is neither mind nor body, out which both can spring.<br><br>
        Let us begin with the body. The plain man thinks that material objects must certainly exist, since they are evident to the senses. Whatever else may be doubted, it is certain that anything you can bump into must be real; this is the plain man's metaphysic. This is all very well, but the physicist comes along and shows that you never bump into anything: even when you run your hand along a stone wall, you do not really touch it. When you think you touch a thing, there are certain electrons and protons, forming part of your body, which are attracted and repelled by certain electrons and protons in the thing you think you are touching, but there is no actual contact. The electrons and protons in your body, becoming agitated by nearness to the other electrons and protons are disturbed, and transmit rangi necessary disturbance along your nerves to the brain; the effect in the brain is what is to your sensation of contact, and by suitable experiments this sensation can be made quite deceptive. The electrons and protons themselves, however, are only crude first approximations, a way of collecting into a bundle either trains of waves or the statistical probabilities of various different kinds of events. Thus matter has become altogether too ghostly to be used as an adequate stick with which to beat the mind. Matter in motion, which used to seem so unquestionable, turns out to be a concept quite inadequate for the needs of physics.<br><br>
        Nevertheless modern science gives no indication whatever of the existence of the soul or mind as an entity: indeed the reasons for disbelieving in it are very much of the same kind as the reasons for disbelieving in matter. Mind and matter were something like the lion and the unicorn fighting for the crown; the end of the battle is not the victory of one or the other, but the discovery that both are only heraldic inventions. The world consists of events, not of things that endure for a long time and have changing properties. Events can inges cang be collected into groups by their causal relations. If the causal relations are of one sort, the resulting group of events may be called a physical object, and if causal relations are of another sort, the resulting group may be called a mind. Any event that occurs inside a man's head will belong to groups of both kinds, considered as belonging to a group of one kind, it is a constituent of his brain, and considered as belonging to a group of the other kind, it is a constituent of his mind.<br><br>
        Thus, both mind and matter are merely convenient ways of organizing events. There can be no reason for supposing that either a piece of mind or a piece of matter is immortal The sun is supposed to be losing matter at the rate of millions of tons a minute. The most essential characteristic of ind is memory, and is no reason whatever to suppose that the memory associated with a given person survives that person's death. Indeed there is every reason to think the opposite, for memory is clearly connected with a certain kind of brain structure, and since this structure decays at death, there is every reason to suppose that memory also must cease. Although metaphysical materialism cannot be considered true, yet emotionally the world is pretty much the same as I would be if the materialists were in the right. I think the opponents of materialism have always been actuated by two main desires: the first to prove that the mind is immortal, and the second to prove that the ultimate power in the universe is mental rather than physical. In both these respects, I think the materialists were in the right. Our desires, it is true, have considerable power on the earth's surface, the greater part of the land on this planet has a quite different aspect from that which it would have if men had not utilized it to extract food and wealth. But our power is very strictly limited. We cannot at present do anything whatever to the sun or moon or even to the interior of the earth, and there is not the faintest reason to suppose that what happens in regions to which our power does not extend has any mental causes. That is to say, to put the matter in a nutshell, there is no reason to think that except on the earth's surface anything happens because somebody wishes it to happen. And since our power on the earth's surface is entirely dependent upon the sun, we could hardly realize any of our wishes if the sun grew could. It is of course rash to dogmatize as to what science may achieve in the future. We may leam to prolong human existence longer than now seems possible, but if there is any truth in modern physics, more particularly in the second law thermodynamics, we cannot hope that the human race will continue forever. Some people may find this conclusion gloomy, but if we are honest with ourselves, we shall have to admit that what is going to happen many millions of years hence has no very great emotional interest for us here and now. And science, while it diminishes our cosmic pretensions, enormously increases our terrestrial comfort. That is why, in spite of the horror of the theologians, science has on the whole been tolerated.<br><br>

    <h2>Comprehension</h2>
    <h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	What's the difference between the body and the soul?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Man consists of a soul and body, that the body is in time and space, but the soul is in time only. Abstract soul stays in a physical body. Body is physical structure made of flesh, bones, and blood. Soul is the abstract and more often spiritual concept believed to have existed even after the death of a body.<br><br>
        <strong>b. 	What do you understand by the psychologists saying that there is no such thing as mind?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The psychologists theory states that conscious mental state must be among the contents of working memory. The user interface of our mind is available to other functions such as decision making and verbalization. They are not in working memory nor are we directly aware of them. Mind is and occurrence. Mental activity reduces everything to the bodily functions. Mind orders to do the activity before our physical organs get ready to come in action.<br><br>
        <strong>c.	How can a mental activity be reduced to a physical activity? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Physical activity and mental stimulation are both considered vital for keeping ourselves active in our life. There are various difficulties in the way of reducing mental activity to physical activity, Daily exercises, like jogging swimming. cycling, gardening, dancing, doing yoga and meditation, have been proved to reduce anxiety and depression. The modern would be materialist thus finds himself in a curious position that for a while, he may, with a certain degree of success. reduce the activities of the mind to those of the body. The scientists cannot explain the fact that the body itself is merely a convenient concept invented by the mind.<br><br>
        <strong>d.	How are mind and body related?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The mind-body connection is the link a person's thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors and their physical health. While scientists have long understood that our emotions can affect our bodies, we're just now beginning to understand how emotions influence health and longevity. The mind and body are connected through neural pathways made up of neurotransmitters, hormones and chemicals. <br><br>
        These pathways transmit signals between the body and the brain to control our everyday functions, from breathing, digestion and pain sensations to movement, thinking and feeling. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>e.	What is the relation between mind and memory? Does memory survive a person's death?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Memory, the biologically encoded information, is the long lasting and stable change that is caused by learning through the series of experiments on target memory recall. The essential characteristic of mind is memory, and there is no reason whatever to suppose that the memory associated with a person survives after that person's death. <br><br>
        Memory clearly connected with a certain kind of brain structure is decayed at death. There is every reason to support that memory also ceases. If a person dies, all supportive parts of memory decay and there remains no any medium to transform the message to the brain. So, any experience recollected in the past can't be recalled by the brain after a person's death.
        <br><br>
        <strong>f.	How is our power on the earth's surface entirely dependent upon the sun? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>We cannot do anything whatever to the sun or moon or even to the interior of the earth. We could hardly realize our situation if the sun grew cold. Without the sun's. heat and light the Earth would be lifeless ball of ice coated rock. The son warms our seas, stirs our atmosphere, generates our weather patterns and gives energy to the growing green plants that provide the food and oxygen for life on earth. If there is any truth in modem physics, more particularly in the second law of thermodynamics, we can't hope that the human race will continue forever.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Critical thinking</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	Do you believe that soul really exists? Write your arguments in support of your answer.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The belief that souls exist and humans have them enjoys near unanimous support in the general population. It is one of the most contentious issues among philosophers and scientists, however. Many philosophers and scientists reject the soul hypothesis to consider what the nonexistence of the soul would entail. <br><br>
        It is important to note that the soul is not merely the mind. Although soul believers may equal soul with minds, one can believe in mind without believing in souls. For example one can believe that the mind is something other than the brain, but also maintain that all mental activity is dependent upon brain activity. Belief in soul requires one to believe that mental activity is separable from the brain-which it can continue without the brain. Unlike belief in souls belief in existence of minds is still the norm in most academic circle. If the soul pre-exists the body, it is reasonable to assume that it exists after death as well. The belief that the soul continues its existence after the death of the body is a matter of philosophical or theological speculation rather than that of a simple faith.
        <br><br>
        <strong>b.	If you want to change your body, you first have to change your mind. Discuss. </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>If we want to change our body, we need to start with the mind. The first step to any change in life starts with our mindset. Mind is considered to function as a commanding force to hold power of controlling our bodily actions. In other words, actions are the bodily manifestations of the commands of the mind. For example, scientists have discovered the facts that constant worry and stress over jobs, finances, or other problems can cause tense muscles, pain, headaches, and stomach problems. It may also lead to high blood pressure or other serious problems. These problems can far be reduced in our bodies by keeping our mind free from tensions and anxieties.<br><br>

    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <h3>Write Critically on the following topics</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a. The existance of god</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Opinions relating in favour of and in opposition to the existence of god have been controversial from many years and anticipated by philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others. The discussion with reference to the existence of god is very traditional and one of the most argued subjects in human history. <br><br>
        The perception of God normally relates to a monotheistic, superlative, eventual and personal being. This view is mostly originated from Christian and Hebrew traditions. Traditional view Portrayed God as having perfections in everything. Many religions and different societies believe that God is a body that can't be defined. Some traditional approaches defined God as "the prime mover" or the uncaused cause, the ultimate creator or a being nothing greater than which can be conceived. <br><br>
        Most schools of Hinduism believe that there is existence of god but some of them don't believe that. Law of Karma provides basis of the existence of God. They believe that the action of Karma is not performed by human's self, there must be existence of God to control and monitor all Karmas (actions). They also believe that fruit of Karma is transferred and dispensed through a body that is known as God and thus proves the existence. <br><br>
        The disapproving argument claims that there is no visible God. There is no any reason to believe that there is a God. If somebody calls God in danger & crisis and he/she achieves something or gets the idea to solve the problem, its existence could be considered valid But believing in God's existence people have morality, faith and harmony to human nature . <br><br>
        <br><br>
        <strong>b.	Religion influences ethics and morality</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Ethics and morality relate to "right" and "wrong" conduct. While they are i sometimes used interchangeably, they are different ethics refer to rules provided by an external source, e.g., codes of conduct in workplaces or principles in religions. Morality often refers to an individual's own principles regarding right and wrong. <br><br>
        Often, religion and ethics are treated as the same thing, with various religions making claims about their belief systems being the best way for people to live actively and try to convert unbelievers. Not all religions are the same, some are more liberal than others and some more conservative, but in general, all religious traditions believe that their faith represents a path to enlightenment and salvation. <br><br>
        By contrast, ethics are universal decision-making tools that may be used by a person of any religious belief and even an atheist. While religion makes claims about cosmology, social behaviour, and the proper treatment of others, ethics are based on logic and reason rather than tradition or injunction. <br><br>

    <p>
        <strong>Ans. </strong><br>
        Sometimes I used to play with my little plastic cowboys and Indians on the kitchen windowsill, and the window in the kitchen, it was just one window, and it was at the end of the kitchen, and it opened into a courtyard, the front courtyard, and across the courtyard on the other side, the apartment was exactly the same, but it was my mother friend Mrs. Bernie, was her name. Uh, I don't remember her first name, but they used to talk back and forth across the courtyard. And Mrs. Bernie, whenever she made chocolate chip cookies, she would always call me out the kitchen window, if she saw Ime playing with my toys on the windowsill, she'd call and say, "I made chocolate chip cookies for you." "Did she make good cookies?" "Oh she made great chocolate chip cookies. They weren't flat. They were like bumpy. I mean they were not real big, but they were just, awesome, they were great I can taste them right now. (laughs) And then I would go next door. I would go out into the hall, go down to the end of the wall to her apartment, and she would give me a dish full of chocolate chip cookies. The other thing I remember about her is that she always had exotic animals. She had a skunk, a de-scented skunk at one point. She had birds, big birds. I think she had a rabbit. Not all at once, but at different times. And she also had a dog, Skippy, and she used to let me take Skippy out for a walk once in a while. And I thought that was a big deal because we didn't have a dog.

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;What Lost Identity? The Diaspora and Globalisation</p>
    <h2>Before you read</h2>
    <h3>a. Why do you think people leave their home countries? </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>People leave their home countries in search of better employment opportunities and
        securities of life. </p>
    <h3>b. Do they have their cultural identity in other countries?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>We cannot tell with certainty whether a cultural identity remains intact in the host
        countries where immigrants seek shelter. For example, one cannot distinctly locate the Nepalese indigenous
        identity in the USA. At the same time, Indian culture is far more visible there.</p>
    <h3>c. What happens when one's identity is lost?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>When one's identity is lost, s/he becomes a part of globalised culture.</p>
    <h3>d. How is culture globalised?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In my view, when one's local or original identity is swept by a bigger culture, the global
        culture prevails.</p>
    <p><strong>Now read the following article about identity loss for the immigrants.</strong></p>
    <p>
        Most of the 5 million Palestinians are refugees. More than two million live in Western. Europe and North
        America. They left Palestine and the refugee camps where they were denied basic human rights to find a better
        life and better economic opportunities. Most North African Arabs (Egyptians, Moroccans, Tunisians, and
        Algerians) left their home countries to look for a better economic life.<br><br>
        However, Syrian and Lebanese nationals left their countries not only to improve their economic situation but
        also to escape from the ravages of the ongoing conflicts there.<br><br>
        There are those who fear the loss of cultural identity when confronted with the process of cultural
        assimilation. Personally, I believe that no institution, government, group or people can clinically separate the
        young generations from the huge waves of technological advancement that shape and form this global culture,
        which is, after all, part of our new global identity. We are living in the 21st century where social media,
        street journalism and global transnational corporations participate in providing a catalyst for the new dynamics
        of global culture formation, quite apart from the issue of identity which can be defined in terms of religion,
        culture or language. This signifies that we should not confuse cultural identity with global culture.<br><br>
        However, moving from one side of the world to the other can be an economic challenge. for newcomers and host
        nations alike in places like Western Europe and North America. When the immigrants arrive, the host country
        needs to integrate them into the labour market, with the prospect of achieving a better life for them and
        facilitating their contribution to the economy. This cannot happen in a one-step or one-shop integration
        programme; it needs time, starting from learning the language, integrating culturally with finally, integration
        into the labour market. Although in the short-term this strategy may prove costly for the government, in the
        long run, it will make a positive contribution to the economy. Immigrants, however, may find themselves ignored
        or isolated by society, even though society may see itself as open and immigrant-friendly. This can be seen in
        the housing situation where immigrants can rent only from housing agencies and in specific areas. Small enclaves
        in cities where immigrants are concentrated begin to spring up. Take Rosengard in Malmo, Sweden, for instance,
        where most immigrants can be found and the crime rate is among the highest in the country. Or Lavapies, a
        central historic neighbourhood in Madrid, Spain now home to a high concentration of immigrants from China,
        Bangladesh and the Middle East Enclaves such as these can be costly to the government and to the immigrants
        themselves as life in these neighbourhoods often runs parallel to official society and its culture, and
        integration is not truly achieved.<br><br>
        Many immigrants have started their own businesses in their new homes. Twenty years ago, you could hardly find
        Palestinian hummus or falafel in any European markets. Today, there are small entrepreneurs who have set up
        shops to sell Arabic, Hindi, African, Latin American foods and other products, and there is an increasing amount
        of trade between these countries. Spice exports from India to Saudi Arabia has increased the total sum of
        economic trade to 80 billion Saudi Riyals. This is not because of the sheer quality of Indian spices, but
        because of the numbers of Indians who live in Saudi Arabia naturally for economic reasons. Trade between Turkey
        and Germany has reached the 25 billion-curo mark and the number of German tourists to Turkey is an estimated 4
        million. This illustrates how the existence of immigrants can foster economics at different magnitudes of
        scale.<br><br>
        Personally, I had the chance to meet many immigrants who were all willing to integrate in the Swedish and
        Spanish societies where they live. Admittedly, there are many constraints at play, but these constraints are not
        related to any loss of identity. In fact, Western societies' creation of immigrant enclaves enables neighbours
        to share similar identities, cultures, language and perhaps even religion. This, however, has a negative effect
        in the long run, and it will be the second generation and the government who in the end will pay dearly.
        Integration programmes do not fail because immigrants are unwilling to be part of the new society, but because
        society does not open its doors fully to allow them to integrate. Full integration could be costly at first, but
        at the end of the day, it is an investment in the future. Currently, many schools in Sweden are teaching Arabic
        as a second language for immigrants and provide students with halal food. Any argument about loss of identity in
        the West does not have a solid foundation.<br><br>
        Countless benefits come from integrating into society. It means that people will focus more on economic
        opportunities rather than concentrating their efforts on lamenting a so-called identity crisis. And it means
        they will become sensitised to the norms and standards of the new society - its garbage collection, its traffic
        lights, its highway code etc. and start to adopt new ways of thinking. The new generation will have the
        opportunity of boarding the ship of civilisation and development that Arabs have lost a long time ago. They will
        have equal opportunities in learning, engagement and self esteem. Afterwards, they can be a solid bridge between
        the two cultures or religions-of course, with mutual understanding. On the other hand, the receiving countries
        will enhance their economic opportunities where immigrants come from. The number of multinational corporations
        and businesses are increasing because of the increasing number of immigrants in the receiving countries. This
        will boost an economic, political and cultural interaction between the two sides. Governments of Europe and
        North America should start their integration programmes by encouraging newcomers to establish their own
        businesses that link them to their homeland. This will make it easier to understand, smoothly integrate and
        contribute to the economy.<br><br>
        Finally, we must admit that if we do not run in accordance with global culture, it will eventually usurp us
        without even knowing it. The cost of isolation and non convergence is higher and more damaging than integration.
        The fear of losing identity. must be faced with positive interaction between newcomers and their hosting
        societies. In the end, most newcomers are guests and must leave a positive impression when they leave, or they
        are part of this society and they must adapt with it and build their future in conjunction with their new
        surroundings.<br><strong>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Abdalhadi

    <h2>Comprehension</h2>
    <h3>Answer the following questions.</h3>
    <h3>a. Why did millions of Palestinians leave their country?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Millions of Palestinians left their country because they were denied basic human rights. To
        find better life and better economic opportunities, they left their home country.</p>
    <h3>b. How is the global culture formed? Is cultural identity possible even in the global culture? Justify.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Technological advancement, social media, trans-national corporations participate in
        providing a catalyst to form the new dynamics of global culture. It is because no institution, government, group
        or people can clinically separate the new generation from the huge wave of technological advancement, social
        media and cross-cultural behaviourism.</p>
    <h3>c. Why can moving from one side of the world to the other be an economic challenge for newcomers?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The immigrants arrive in a new land by leaving their ancestral homeland. In this movement,
        they face linguistic and cultural differences which might make it very difficult for them to find jobs. This, in
        turn, might lead the immigrants to economic hardships.</p>
    <h3>d. How can immigrants foster an economy at different magnitudes of scale in their new homes?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Many immigrants start their own business in their new homes. Small entrepreneurs set up
        small shops to sell their traditional cultural products in the new places of settlement. Apart from this, many
        Multinational Corporations and businesses are also established depending upon the labour force based on the
        immigrants. These new arrivals are both prepared and equally motivated to work far harder than usual to make
        their life more comfortable. This hardworking trend evidently enhances the economy of the country hosting the
        immigrants.</p>
    <h3>e. Can immigrants fully integrate in the new societies? Give reasons.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>No, it's not fully possible for the immigrants to integrate in the new societies since the
        hosts do not open their doors to allow the new comers cultures: integrate into their.</p>
    <h3>f. Mention any two benefits of integrating into a new society for the immigrants.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Two benefits of integrating into new societies are:<br>
        (i) Economic opportunities<br>
        (ii) Adoption of new ways of thinking and doing works.
    </p>
    <h3>g. Why should the immigrants run in concordance with global culture?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The immigrants should run in concordance with global culture to prevent the loss of their
        cultural and societal identities</p>
    <h2>Critical thinking</h2>
    <h3>a. Do you think that the local is globalised and the global is localised? Can there be the global culture as
        well? Give examples.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Globalization is the word used to describe the growing interdependence of the world's
        economics, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and
        flows of investment, people, and information. In contrast, localization is considered as the process of
        preventing the movement of people, goods, information, norms, practices, and institutions outside those specific
        boundaries.<br><br>
        Globalisation and localisation are interrelated terms. They get their meanings in the presence of each other.
        Sometimes, the local can be globalised and the global can be localized. The world has literally grown to be a
        global village. That is to say we are adopting global culture even without our knowledge. For example, Denim (a
        jenns brand of Italian and French origin) is now popularly worn by the youths across the globe.
    </p>
    <h3>b. What is globalisation? Discuss the effects of globalization on traditional cultures.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>(See Answer a. above for the definition of globalization.) <br>
        It goes without saying that globalization has impacted almost every walks of our life. The social values seem to
        be clearly affected by the global culture. The cultural practices, like food habit, housing, fashion, and social
        etiquettes, have drastically changed. Basic indigenous norms and values are at the verge of extinction. For
        instance, in Nepal, the youngsters prefer junk foods to home made dishes. Social media culture is flourishing at
        an unstoppable speed. the process and progress of education
    </p>
    <h3>c. Discuss the impacts of globalization on in Nepal.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Globalization is a process, which has affected many areas of human life, one of those being
        education. In the twentieth century, many developing countries have experienced growth in the educational
        facilities available to them due to the entry of institutions from the West. Some believe that this process is
        an invaluable opportunity for the people of the developing countries to raise their skills and standards of
        education. Others fear that it is merely a modem version of cultural imperialism that will lead to the creation
        of a universal, ultimately Western society: Through Globalization of education, which is being knowledge
        transfer from the Western countries into developing countries, is intended to improve the skills and
        capabilities of the people receiving it.<br><br>
        Education is undergoing constant changes under the effects of Globalization. The effects of Globalization on
        education bring rapid developments in technology and communications are foreseeing changes within school systems
        across the world as
        ideas, values and knowledge, changing the roles of students and teachers, and producing a shift in society from

    <p>THT Basudev Adhikari</p>
    <p>Last Updated at October 26, 2019 15:20 NST</p>
    <p>Tihar, one of the biggest festivals of Nepal, also known as Deepawali, formally
        began on Saturday with the worship of crow. The five-day festival is celebrated with fervour and gaiety
        worshipping animals as well as the human body. As the celebrations last for five days, it is called the Yama
        Panchak On the first day of Tihar, crows are worshipped as the messengers of death where people put out foods
        for the black-coloured bird. "Kaag (Crow) Tihar is the first day of the Yama Panchak.<br><br> On this day, we
        offer food items that are favourite of Crows, worship them. Food like meat and other grains are offered to
        them," Monika Malla, a resident of Kathmandu said.<br><br>
        "Crow is regarded as the messenger of Lord Yama (God of Death) so we worship it every year." Malla added. The
        second day of Tihar, "Kukur Tihar (Dog Tihar)" is observed by worshipping dog as the guard of the house. Later
        on Sunday evening, Laxmi (Goddess of Wealth) Pooja will be celebrated according to the calendar of Nepal
        Panchanga Niyamak Samiti.<br><br>
        The Newar Community of Nepal would celebrate the third day of Yama Panchak as Laxmi Pooja whereas the fourth day
        as Mha Pooja (Worship of self).

    Now read the following book review of the novel Half A Life. <br>
    HALF A LIFE<br>
    V.S. Naipaul<br>
    Knopf, 2001, 211 pp.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>V.S. Naipaul marks his rise to Nobel laureate, however accidentally, with a strange new novel that is at once of a piece with and apart from most of his previous work. On the one hand it is a continuation of his preoccupation with the innumerable questions raised by cultural and racial identity, on the other hand its spare, melancholy, clusive, somewhat heavily ironic tone contrasts with the more animated quality of his best fiction (A House for Mr. Biswas, for example), and the graphic sex with which its final sections are filled is a stark departure from his almost priggish treatment of the subject previously.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter18img2.jpg">

<p>The heart of the novel can be found in a brief scene three-quarter of the way through. At a rough restaurant on the coast of the African nation where he is living, Willie Chandran encounters a "big light-eyed man" man who is being abused by his Portuguese boss as he goes about his work as a tiler. Afterward Willie's lover, Ana, herself part Portuguese and part African, tells him that the tiler is illegitimate, with an African mother and an important Portuguese landowner for a father. "The rich Portuguese put their illegitimate mulatto children to learning certain trades," she tells him: "Electrician, mechanic, metal worker, carpenter, tiler," to which Willie responds: "I said nothing more to Ana. But whenever I remembered the big sweating man with the abused light eyes, carrying the shame of his birth on his face like a brand, I would think. Who will rescue that man? Who will avenge him?" "</p>


<p>It is a question of the utmost urgency to Willic, and the central motif of Half a Life, Naipaul's 13th novel. It is about a man-- the phrase is used to describe someone else, but it clearly is meant to describe Willie as well - "who appeared to have no proper place in the world." He is spending this, what we are to take to be the first half of his life, trying to find such a place, "just letting the days go by," trusting "that one day something would happen, an illumination would come to him, and he would be taken by a set of events to the place he should go."</p>

<p>Willie was born in India 40-some years ago. His father was a "man of high caste, high in the maharaja's revenue service," who heard the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the early 1930s and decided to make a sacrifice of himself, a "lasting kind of sacrifice, something the mahatma would have approved of." Rather than marry in his own caste he would choose "the lowest person I could find" He settled upon a fellow college student, who was "small and coarse featured, almost tribal in appearance, noticeably black, with two big top teeth that showed very white," clearly a woman of "a backward caste."</p>

<p>This man of sacrifice is noticed by the eminent British writer Somerset Maugham, who comes to India (in a cameo role) to research a book. Eventually he emerges in Maugham's portrait as someone of great spirituality and self-sacrifice, a role he knows is far from accurate but into which he finds himself slipping casily and comfortably. But those of whom the greatest sacrifice is exacted are the two children of this strange and unhappy relationship, Willie and his sister. Bitterly unhappy in India, loving his mother and despising his father, Willic manages to get a scholarship to a second-rate college in London and flees there.</p>


<p>In college and in London itself, Willie "thought he was swimming in ignorance, had lived without a knowledge of time." Yet in and out of school, his education proceeds apace. Thousands of miles from home, he begins to sense the condescension and indifference with which the British had treated his father, and disdain gradually metamorphoses into empathy. He also begins to understand that "the old rules [of India] no longer bound him," that "freedom was his for the asking." It is a revelation: "No one he met, in the college or outside it, knew the rules of Willie's own place, and Willie began to understand that he was free to present himself as he wished. He could, as it were, write his own revolution. The possibilities were dizzying. He could, within reason, remake himself and his past and his ancestry."</p>

<p>This is exactly what he does. He fabricates a past for himself that denies his divided identity and presents himself as whole. For a while he participates in "the special, passing bohemian-immigrant life of London of the late 1950s," though eventually he realizes that "the lost, the unbalanced, the alcoholic, the truly bohemian those parties in shabby Notting Hill flats no longer seemed metropolitan and dazzling." By this point he has created a minor career for himself as part-time author of scripts for the BBC, which gives him courage to try his hand at writing stories. He takes scenes and plots from movies with Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart and reworks them to his own purposes, finding that "it was easier, with these borrowed stories far outside his own experience, and with these characters far outside himself, to be truer to his feelings than it had been with his cautious, half-hidden parables at school."</p>
<p>For a time it works: "Whenever Willie felt he was running out of material, running out of cinematic moments, he went to see old movies or foreign movies." It doesn't last. In time -- inevitably -- his writing "began to lead him to difficult things, things he couldn't face, and he stopped." He cobbles together a little book of stories that is published and almost universally neglected, save by a young woman of mixed African background who tells him in a letter that "in your stories for the first time I find moments that are like moments in my own life." This is Ana. They meet, though he is apprehensive: "But as soon as he saw her all his anxieties fell away, and he was conquered. She behaved as though she had always known him, and had always liked him. She was young and small and thin, and quite pretty. She had a wonderfully easy manner. And what was most intoxicating for Willie was that for the first time in his life he felt himself in the presence of someone who accepted him completely. At home his life had been ruled by his mixed inheritance. [But with Ana] there was, so to speak, nothing to push against, no misgiving to overcome, no feeling of distance."</p>
<p>So when she decides to go back home to her Portuguese African country, he accompanies her. In "that regulated colonial world" in which "to be even a second-rank Portuguese was to have a kind of high status," he finds "a complete acceptance." Though this does not change, he "began to understand and was helped in this understanding by my own background that the world I had entered was only a half-and-half world, that many of the people who were our friends considered themselves, deep down, people of the second rank." Wherever he turns, he finds people whose place in the world is no more certain or secure than his own, though at the end of his African sojourn he is still so caught up in his own fears, resentments and anxieties that he fails to grasp that this is, in truth, a universal condition.</p>
<p>
    It is for Naipaul, not Willie Chandran, to make this central point. He does so with subtlety and nuance. The novel is told by an omniscient narrator - perhaps to distance Naipaul and his own experience from Willie and his story -- but the point of view is self-evidently Willie's. He is a man of intelligence and character who is blind to the full truth about himself, at once worldly and self-deceiving. It is a state of mind that is, or should be, familiar to all too many of us.

<h2>Comprehension</h2>
<h2>Answer these questions.</h2>
<h3>a.	How is Willie Chandran different from the rest of his family?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Willy Chandan is different from the rest of his family because he is insecure about himself and his own identity.</p>
<h3>b.	Who is the main character of Half A Life? How is he described?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Willie Chandan is the main character of Half a life. He was born in India to a brahmin father and a poor mother. Jonathan Yardley describes him as "who appeared to have no proper place in the world." He struggles with his role in life and is persistently unsure about love, often falling into unsure relationships. He spends his entire life searching self-satisfaction and stability in his life</p>
<h3>c.	Why does Willie leave India?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Willie leaves India because he manages to get scholarship to a second-rate college in London. Actually, he wants to establish a stable identity in his new destination.</p>
<h3>d.	What is the revelation that Willie begin to feel in college and in London?</h3>
<p>Ans.	In London, Willie he begins to sense the indifference with which the British had treated his father, and disdain gradually changes into empathy. He also begins to understand that the old rules of India no longer bind him. He realizes that he can exercise freedom there.</p>
<h3>e.Why does Willie accompany Ana?</h3>

<p>Ans.	Willie accompanies Ana, a Portuguese-African woman, to Mozambique because he has found someone who accepts him completely. At home his life has been ruled by his mixed inheritance, but with Ana there is nothing to push against, no misgiving to overcome, and no feeling of distance.</p>
<h3>f.	What is the central issue Naipaul has raised in the novel? </h3>
<p>Ans.	The central issue Naipaul has raised in the novel is the crisis of cultural and racial identity. An Identity crisis is a period of serious personal questioning where the individual makes an effort to determine one's own values and sense of direction. Naipaul's characters, especially the protagonist, suffer from the lack of stable identity.</p>

<h2>Critical thinking</h2>
<h3>a.	What kind of divided identity is depicted in the novel Half A Life? How do characters in the novel try to create new identities for themselves? Explain.</h3>
<p>Ans.	The theme of exile and longing for identity is central to the novel Half a Life. It is apparently a record of Will's quest for identity. The author focuses on the main character's attempt to assert his personal identity in almost every chapter. Identity is the reason Willie Chandran's father rejected his own family and married a woman of low caste. He wanted to do something worthwhile in the country, like follow the independence movement, and thus forge a new identity for himself. Willie wants to create a new identity for himself as well and escapes his home in India to get rid of the identity of his childhood that was tainted by his father's actions. Later in London, Willie tries to make a new identity in the university. He lies about his family and says he is from an ancient Christian settlement in India. Willie does this to inject confidence into his identity and separate his identity from that of his father's. He also engages in sexual adventures to once more form a sense of confidence in his identity and distinguish the differences between him and his father. Finally, we also see the theme of identity in Ana and Willie when they move to Ana's estate house in the Portuguese colony in Africa. Both of them live there for many years, trying to form new identities for themselves and change their perspective on who they are. At the end, both feel as if they have not forged new. identities and must go on separate paths to once more find themselves.</p>

<h3>b.	Discuss the similarities between the author and the protagonist in the novel. </h3>
<p>Ans.	There lies a great deal of parallelism between Willie Chandran and the author V.S. Naipaul. Naipaul is of Indian descent, like his protagonist. He left his home country at the age of 18 to go study abroad; both of them were able to do this because of a scholarship. Willie went to England to study at a university for four years as well. He took up writing and published a book while he was studying in London and briefly pursued writing, which is Naipaul's occupation. They both eventually find themselves living in a foreign country other than the one they were born in. It is clear that V.S. Naipaul used aspects of his own life to craft and mold a protagonist and a story that would be powerful and compelling enough to keep readers glued to the page.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3>A. Study the general format of a book review and film review.</h3>

Similarly, a film review is a review that provides a short description of a film including the reviewer's opinion about it. A scholarly review should use formal language. The format of a book and film review is presented below.

<h3>B.	Write a review of a book/film you have recently read or watched.
 </h3>
<p><strong>Ans.	Chakka Panja 3</strong>
<br>
<p>Director: Deepa Shree Niraula</p>
<p>Producer: Deepa Shree Niraula, Deepak Raj Giri, Jitu Nepal. Kedar Ghimire</p>
<p>Script by: Deepak Raj Giri, Jitu Nepal, Kedar Ghimire, Yaman stha</p>
<p>Cast: Deepika Prasain, Swastima Khdka, Priyanka Karki, Deepak Raj Giri, Jitu Nepal, Kedar Ghimire, Shivahari Poudel, Buddhi Tamang</p>
<p>Genre: Comedy, Satire</p>
<p>Time: 145 minutes</p>
<p>Release Date: 1 October 2018</p>
<p>Language: Nepali</p>
<p>Last week I got a chance to watch this spectacular movie. The moment of awe was something that I experienced when I came across the impeccable storyline of the film and acting of the characters. It narrates the story of a headmaster's daughter. who tries to improve conditions at a Nepalese government school.</p>
<p>Established comedians Deepak Raj Giri and Deepa Shree Niraula have made sincere efforts to make their audience laugh for around two-and-half hours. Though there are some flaws in the story, which takes up some 'serious issues prevalent in Nepal, the movie is successful in meeting its objective of giving the audience a complete fun package during this festive season.</p>
<p>The movie is not only a plain farce but also a satire on multiple ironies of the Nepali society. A govemment-run secondary school in a semi-developed village in western Nepal is at the centre of the film. The school is an amalgamation of mismatches: the principal is unable to make his staff work, the teachers spend most of the afternoons playing cards or working as land brokers. The school also works as a party venue for aristocrats of the village. Local leaders have made the school management committee a playground where they compete against each other to get hold of the villagers votes. A nearby private school, operated by close kin of the leaders, deploys its resources to perpetuate the crisis. Consequently, the students are at the receiving end. Most of them fail final secondary examinations. Many of them drop out. Those who wish to learn well complain to the authorities, who do not pay any heed, because they are also puppets of corrupt political leaders.</p>
<p>The biggest flaw of the project is the choice of its theme and setting. It has become a laughing stock itself in its failure to understand the gravity of the situation. It also tries to raise its voice about inter-caste marriage. However, it is not well articulated and justified. Nevertheless, it's a movie that I wouldn't mind re-watching ten times more.</p>

<h2>Now read the following travelogue by the Philippine freelance writer, Megan Leung about her five-week adventurous experiences of visiting western Nepal. What do you do when you get lost along your travels?</h2>

<P>Along my five-week walk in the western Himalayas of Nepal, a colourful rooster heavy on pink feathers fluffed its roseate plumes at me as though to say, "Yes, bideshi, it's all real'. The flightless bird and I stared at each other for a brief moment/(momentum) and I could have sworn it winked at me. By this point, my sanity had already gone hazy, unlike the clear blue skies above the high passes of Dolpa.</P>

<p>Further along the trail, patches of pink grass and purple flora sprinkled the ground. Sundried shrubs filled the crisp Himalayan air with the familiar sweetness of chamomile. Stone houses held themselves together under a rock, above a river, looking too crumbly to live in, but the inhabitants didn't seem to mind. I wondered how much more oddity hides and flourishes in West Nepal. I wasn't supposed to be in this region. But, as with any good story, a happy accident would see me walking through the country's unknown trails. </p>

<p>Having been living on the road as a traveller for four years now and visiting Nepal for the third time, I wanted to push the envelope and experience places where few tourists go. I chose the Dhaulagiri Circuit. The day I started my walk I asked bus drivers in Beni to point me towards the direction of Tatopani. As it were, there are two Tatopani - one on the east along the Annapurna Circuit, one on the west along the Dhaulagiri Circuit. I would end up in the cast and I would learn too late that I was on the other side of where I wanted to be. My options would be to turn back or to swim in the pickle I was in. I took my map out and decided to walk up to Mukhtinath.</p>

<p>In a guest house in Lower Mustang I met an Englishman walking the Great Himalayan Trail. We exchanged stories over cups of hot raksi to warm our cold selves and after looking at his map I decided to make a pilgrimage to Rara Lake.</p>

<P>In Darbang I stopped to resupply food and walked towards a village named Sibang, 15 kilometres further as the crow flies but we are talking about the largest mountains of this planet. It was a long day. From one lush green hill to another, I went mathi and tala, mathi and tala, through warm temperate forests, under giant spider webs, over rapids, beside glassy waterholes too tempting to swim in, if not for their stinging coldness.</P>

<p>In a scenic village named Lamsung, a young couple welcomed me in their home where I stayed the night. In the morning, someone offered to give me a ride on his horse (for a fee) but I decided to keep using my own legs.</p>

<p>In Bhujekhung I washed my clothes and myself by the river. The didi who hosted me for the night called 'sutne (bedtime; literally, to sleep) at seven in the evening. There was no electricity but there was a hole in the ceiling and the bright stars lit the cold dark room up so beautifully that I didn't mind.</p>

<p>The next day, a 10-hour walk to Dorpatan had me marching until past sunset. I had to take my shoes off to make a river crossing. I knew that the slippery rocks and angry glacial water were going to be a painful adventure. A bahini crossed the river and took my pack, made me wear her flipflops, held me by the hand, instructed me where exactly to place my feet, and got me across. Her girl friends were all cheering, I said my tourist classic Namaste, hugged them all, and moved on.</p>
<p>When finally, I found a base for the night, I was soon joined by local politicians from Kathmandu who were on an official trip. The evening stretched as we all danced in the dining room, Nepali music on full blast.
    A  village named Thankur had only two houses: On the way there, I had a mild heart attack as three large birds suddenly took flight from a tree next to the footpath. It was an arid region with not much life visible in the periphery but these birds were large, shiny, and rainbow-coloured. They were the national bird of Nepal, the Himalayan monal. That wasn't the last surprise for the day - the stars in Thankur that evening were blinding, the most brilliant I have ever seen this side of the globe.

<p>In Pelma, I met a Welshman who has been Nepal nine times. I met him again in Dule and we walked towards the Jang La pass and to Dunai. The distance between the two. villages was so long that we decided to camp halfway through the trail. I squeezed into the Welshman's tiny summer tent and attempted to sleep on 4,500-metre altitude: We laughed at the fact that no one else was insane enough to be on that mountain on a cold November night.</p>

<p>Further west into remoter regions, school children led me to a village that sounded like 'Orta', just after Sarmi. The village is built on brown rocks, houses stacked together with open, free-fall decks. A family fed me, sheltered me, and walked with me the day after to show me a shortcut-a snowy pass towards Jumla. I walked for five hours in the snow and a further three hours in cold winds, through ancient alpine forests and exposed mountain ridges. By the time I reached Jumla, I was ill with an unknown virus and a bad tummy. An American I met at a hotel gave me medicine. The pani puri at a local eatery also helped in my recovery. </p>

<P>Once I felt well enough to carry on, I started walking towards Rara, through Khali Lagna and then Bulbule. In Khali Lagna I was welcomed by a didi who was picking the brains out of a sheep skull. She said if I wanted to wash myself there is a bucket of water in the outhouse I checked it out and the water surface on the bucket was frozen. Cracking it felt strangely satisfying and the pani underneath was surprisingly lukewarm.</P>

<p>"One more day." I whispered to myself. I was excited for the last push, thinking it would be an easy final walk. Of course it wasn't. To get to Rara Lake I decided to take a shortcut and cross another pass: On the map, the trail to this pass was barely visible. The suggested route is a 25-kilometre walk. My chosen route was less than half of that. Oh boy.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter19img3.jpg">
<p>I walked through foot-deep snow for hours, my shoes and feet became wet but the sky was blue and the sun was bright and the views were otherworldly, giving me enough to be cheerful about. Once I had reached the pass I was in for a shock: the skinny cliff path was snowed-in There was a steep drop of 300 metres and I was on top of a 4,000-metre mountain. There was nothing to hold on to but. loo e metamorphic rocks; grabbing the wrong one could be fatal. But turning back meant walking more hours, and in the dark.
    Without tent and food, that option was only slightly more dangerous than crossing an icy cliff edge without ice axe and crampons.
    </p>

<p>I dug my heels and hands in the snow, one frozen movement at a time, until I was on the other side. It was cold but my adrenaline ran so high that I was sweating from the suspense. Imagine my relief once I've made it across all four cliff crossings!</p>

<p>And so I arrived at Rara Lake alive and well. The biggest freshwater lake in Nepal. Himalaya was there, glistening in its dark blue glory, waiting for my arrival. The magnificent sky-scraping pine trees decorated the ground with giant pine cones. Coots glided over the crystal clear water, occasionally diving under to disappear and resurface again. White peaks said hello from a distance. There were only two hotels in the national park, at least on the lake side. It's strange to think that Fewa Lake in Pokhara was once this quiet.</p>

<P>Through a five-week long walk, I have covered a distance that totals up to 25 percent of the Nepal Himalaya via the lower Great Himalayan Trail, along with some funky detours. If I ever thought I knew Nepal and its cultures, the west shook that knowing. 
    By and large, I would describe what I witnessed and experienced as medieval and raw. The wild western region is a step or two back in time, when we knew how to survive with our primal instincts, human intuition, and oneness with nature.

<h2>Critical thinking</h2>

<h3>a.	It is said that travelling a place equals to reading three books. Do you agree? Why?</h3>
<P>Ans.	I strongly agree this statement. We can learn many things from both reading and travelling. One can enrich his/her understanding of cultures and places through both of the ventures. However, travelling is more alluring when it comes to learning and understanding. For instance, unlike reading a book, it facilitates self-observation. We learn the things we see more comprehensibly than reading in books.
    Books only give us a general view about the subject of place. It provides us with a one side judgement about something and, in the process, misguides us. In contrast, visiting a place eliminates such prejudices: Similarly, reading bores us whereas travelling keeps entertained and engaged. By nature, our mind catches interesting and attractive insights faster. Books dictate us about the unknown whereas travels take us there. In this regard, both are some sorts of journey, only ere. divergence is that travelling is livelier and funnier. 
    </P>

<h3>b.	The author spent five-week long walk along the western Himalayas. Do you think it was adventurous? Why?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Adventure is the thrill of doing something out of the ordinary. It reduces the melancholy of an individual. Many prefer to go on a solo trip while others don't mind the company of their friends and family members. Megan Leung, a nature lover, had a courage to undertake a solo adventurous journey.
    Leung spent five-week long walk along the western Himalayas. In the travelogue, entitled 'Discovering West Nepal The Wild Frontier', the writer recounts her experiences of discovering westem Nepal. Her journey featured travels to Annapurna and Dhaulagiri circuit. She scaled up a long distance on foot, with her courage as her sole partner. On the way, she had to address the challenges of very dangerous passes, like Jang La Pass. Other rocky and snowy cliffs also posed countless threats to her. However, other natural forces, like birds, lakes and mountains, kept encouraging her all along. The fearless traveller treated all the challenges with a strong courage and persisted on her journey. To speak the truth, the journey was adventurous and heroic.

    <p><strong>Travelogue</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the beautiful places of Nepal is Mustang valley. Muktinath temple simply stands as the most special part of this place. Last month, I got a chance to pay a visit to this favourite tourist destination. In my company, there were other 20 enthusiastic youths. The 5-day tour started with our departure to Pokhara on a tourist bus from Kathmandu. The next day we took a mountain flight from Pokhara to Jomsom. We stayed a hotel and had Dal Bhat with Sukuti and Achar. Local brand of drinking was really pleasing. We spent night in a cozy room with a balcony. From where, we could see golden glory mountain in the easy sunshine. We had our breakfast in the balcony. We observed the snowy peak Himalayan near by the valley. The Mustang valley was really dry and windy at that point of time (October). We saw many rocks, passes and some deep patches of forest, apple orchards and green fields covered with peas and buckwheat. We came across many monasteries and people with prayer wheels. They were speaking Tibetan language and wearing Docha, Bakhu and had long scarps with fur around the neck.</p>
    <p>We took a Jeep to Muktinath Temple. It took us around 2 hours to reach the religious hub. The Jeep dropped us at a certain distance from the Temple and we had to walk the rest. We had to climb around 250-steps to reach the Temple. On reaching the Temple we felt worthy of all the breaks throughout the journey.</p>
    <p>The next day we visited Maharaini Pauwa in Kagbeni. Kagbeni is the confluence of Kaligandaki river and Kag Hhola or Kali Khola. One could find Saligrams (sacred stones) there. Hindus thronged in that place to worship them taking the same for a Hindu God God Bishnu. On day 5, we flew back to Pokhara and took a tourist bus to get back to Kathmandu. The 5-day tour costs us almost 2,50,000 (12, 000 per head).</p>
    <p>The journey to Mustang was quite pleasant. We were warmly welcomed by the local people. We got good hospitality in Jana Shanti School as well. It was an outstanding trip for my life..</p>


<h3>B.	Write an essay in about 500 words on 'Importance of Tourism in Nepal'.</h3>

<p><strong>Tourism in Nepal</strong></p>
<p>Simply putting, tourism is the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure, business or other purposes. Nepal is an all-time favourite tourist destination. It hosts a number of natural, and cultural beauties, gifts, resources and wonders. There are many places and things of cultural, historical and religious importance. Mt. Everest, the highest peak in the world gives the most significant audacity of all. The snow-capped mountain peaks, beautiful water resources, green forests, and mesmerizing flora and fauna add to this signatory position of this small nation.</p>
<p>Nepal has some strong potentialities in the field of tourism. Nature has given us many things which are liked by tourists. Some tourists come here to enjoy the wonders of nature Some of them visit our country for trekking and climbing mountains. Some want to learn something about our history, culture, religion and so on. We can see some tourists come to enjoy their holidays.</p>
<p>We can get many advantages from it. Firstly, we can earn foreign currency which can be used for our development. many people have got employed in the office belonging to tourism. Thus, it helps to reduce the problem of unemployment. Tourists buy native goods and articles of our country. Bas a result, our cottage industries can get benefit. Tourism promotes our hotel industries. Similarly, many tourists guide and porters also get employed. We can learn their language, culture and traditions from the tourists. They also leam many things from us. The fame of our nation gets widened. Our country will be known to all part of the world.</p>
<p>Tourism has brought some problems too. Some of the communicable diseases have been passed to the Nepalese citizens from the tourists. Furthermore, some of the beauty spots are getting polluted because of crowdedness. We can see many bottles, plastic bags, and other non-biodegradable wastes at the peak of the mountains and other tourist destinations. Some of the tourists can be criminals; they commit different anti-social activities and also badly influence innocent Nepalese people to get on the wrong tracks.</p>
<p>Some of the issues are hindering tourism development in Nepal. The major problems are transportation and security. Most of the scenes of beauty are in remote area. We have to build roads to go to these places. Yet we have to depend on air services only. Similarly, the problem of security has also reduced the number tourists. Not to forget that the tourists don't get proper accommodation in the rural areas of remote districts. We should work in unison to promote tourism in Nepal. All the concerned sectors should give equal attention to address tourism related issues.</p>

<h2>Before you read</h2>
<h2>Discuss the following questions with your partner.</h2>
<h3>a.	What modern gadgets do you have?</h3>
<p>Ans.	I have cell phone, laptop, computer, iPod and tablet. </p>
<h3>b. 	Do they make your school life easier and better? How?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Yes. We can access many reference materials in internet. We can learn many things from social media, especially YouTube. During the lockdown, we take online classes on these gadgets.</p>
<h3>c.	In what ways does the use of technology affect our education system?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Use of technology affects our education both positively and negatively. Technology is key in fostering technical skills in both teachers and learners. It has become easier for teachers to impart knowledge and for students to acquire it. The use of technology has made the process of teaching and learning all the more enjoyable. On the other hand, it can decrease students competences of reading and writing. Other flip side of technology in education are the learners getting disconnected from the real world, enough cheating opportunities, disappearance of the printed materials, etc.</p>

<h3>Now read the following essay about Kline's reflection of her college experience, in comparison to her son's college experience.</h3>

<div>
    <div>
    <p>My son Hayden started college last week. Like many parents of freshmen, my husband and I drove him to school together, the back of the car filled with essentials like extralong twin sheets, a clip-on light for his bunk bed and a random mix of extension cords.</p>
    <p>The milk crates, shower caddy and three-ring binders we helped him carry up the stairs flashed me back to my own first days of college - but they weren't the only reason this experience felt so familiar.</p>
    <p>Three decades ago, I was a freshman at the same university. Unlike Hayden, who grew up outside of New York and attended a competitive suburban high school, I was the only student from my small town in Maine to go to Yale, one of the few to even venture out of state. And I had no idea what I was getting into.</p>
    <p>I was lucky, in a way, to be so naive; I didn't what I didn't know. I floated through my first year obliviously unaware of the social currencies being exchanged around me, only dimly perceiving markers of wealth and status.</p>
    <p>When a fellow student bragged about his Alfa Romeo, I thought he meant a Camaro, the fanciest car I'd ever seen. When a classmate casually mentioned that she was meeting her parents in Gstaad for the long weekend, I assumed it was a town in Connecticut. Imagine my surprise when I realized that actual Vanderbilts lived in Vanderbilt Hall.</p>
    <p>But it wasn't just my relative lack of sophistication that made my experience so vastly different from my son's. Typewriters and carbon paper, telephones with curly cords, TVs with a few channels and no remotes, cassette tapes; compared with the tools Hayden has at his disposal, I went to college in the Stone Age.</p>
    <p>Without even thinking about it, my son uses technology in almost everything he does, large and small. He installed Yale-specific apps on his phone that provide information about when the washers and dryers in the basement of his dorm are available, the daily menus of each dining hall, ratings of local restaurants, student contact information, the entire list of classes, and an interactive campus map that shows you where you are and where you're going.</p>
    <p>Within minutes of learning his three suitemates' names this summer, he knew an incredible amount about them: They friended and followed each other on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and immediately had access to each other's prom res, family vacation shots, performance videos, philosophical musings. They established an ongoing group text, exchanging information such as who was bringing an Xbox and who had a coffeemaker. Soon after arriving on campus, Hayden made a spreadsheet of potential classes, vetting them in advance by using teacher rating sites and watching videos of potential professors on YouTube.</p>
    <p>There's no question that my son is better prepared for college than I was. He manages his time better, is more efficient and more directed, and spends less time in lines and more time doing exactly what he sets out to do.</p>
    <p>But I wonder what may be lost. I suspect it's unlikely that he will ever, as I did, trek all the way across campus on a snowy day to a friend's dorm room, only to find that person gone but another roommate available, and making a new friend in the process.</p>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/class11chapter20img1.jpg">
    <p>He won't have to type and retype his papers using Write-Out, no less! - to make revisions, finding in that process new insights into what he's written. I doubt that he'll make his way to a common room at 9 p.m. every Sunday to watch a specific TV show (<em>L.A. Law</em>, I'm thinking of you), bonding with a hearty group of loyalists.</p>
    <p>I think fondly of the rabbit holes L disappeared down when I researched papers for history and English because I couldn't find quite what I was looking for, or because I had to go through so much material to find examples for my thesis.</p>
    <p>When you can type a few words into a search engine and land on your topic - or when you can scan a Shakespeare play for specific words or symbols - what opportunities might you miss to expand your thinking in unexpected ways?</p>
    <p>I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented, learning more about one another from afar but watching programmes on their iPads in their rooms. The knowledge they have at their fingertips may make them more productive, but it may also blunt the thrill of unanticipated discovery.</p>
    <p>Sometime in my first week on that long-ago campus, I found myself hopelessly lost, scrutinizing an indecipherable map, when a freshman boy came up to me. "Can I help you with that?" He asked, and though he didn't know his way around any better than I did, we figured it out together. Twenty-three years of marriage later, we're still figuring it out.</p>
    <p>As Hayden navigates his own journey, I wish for him the satisfaction of productivity and the joy of tapping his potential. But I also hope for him at least some of the wideeyed wonder I felt as a freshman, the delight of discovering a world that was as remote and unknown to me as a foreign country.</p>
    <p>And I hope he'll experience the unexpected pleasures of getting lost, of chance encounters, and the incalculable benefits of time wasted for no good reason at all.</p>

<h2>Comprehension </h2>
<h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
<h3>a.	Why did the author feel that she was lucky to be so naïve of her freshman year at college?</h3>
<p>Ans.	The author felt that she was lucky to be so naive of her freshman year at college because she didn't know what exactly she didn't know. She underwent her fist year being aware of the social currencies exchanged around her only dimly perceiving markers of wealth and status. </p>
<h3>b.	Why did she say that she went to college in the Stone Age?</h3>
<p>Ans.	The writer said that she went to college in the Stone Age because there was not as advanced technological innovation in her time as it is in her son's college year. There had been typewriters and carbon paper, telephone with curly cords, TVs with a few channels without remotes and cassette tapes. Compared to Hayden's day, there were not many gadgets. Internet was still in the womb. She had to read volumes of books and listen to the lectures and note down.</p>
<h3>c.	What kinds of technological tools can Hayden use at his college life unlike at his mother's time? </h3>
<p>Ans.	Hayden can use technology in almost everything. He carries out both large and small chores with the help of it. He installed Yale-specific apps on his phone that provide information about when the washers and dryers in the basement of hist dorm are available, the daily menus of each dining hall, ratings of local restaurant, student contact information, the entire list of classes and interactive campus map, that shows him where he is and where he is going.</p>
<h3>d.	How has the internet and social sites affected the lifestyle of the youths? </h3>
<p>Ans.	The internet and social sites have largely impacted the life style of youth. Within few minutes one can gather any amount of information about anyone through social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Soon after arriving on campus, they make a spread sheet of potential classes, vetting them in advance by using teacher rating sites and watching videos of potential professors on YouTube. However, these technological innovations are not problem-free; in their presence, the youths will face many obstacles in practical life and the tendency to ignore the social norms and values will increase among them.</p>
<h3>e.	What things about college life will Hayden really miss unlike his mother? </h3>
<p>Ans.	She suspects that Hayden will miss trekking all the way across campus on a snowy day to a friend's dorm room only to find that person gone but another roommate available, and making new friend in the process. Moreover, he won't have to type and retype his papers for revisions finding in that process new insights into what he is written. He will also not have the luxury of being in the common room at 9 p.m. every Sunday to watch a specific TV show.</p>

<h3>f.	The writer says, "I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented". Isn't this paradoxical? How?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Yes, the writer sounds quite paradoxical and sarcastic in this statement. The modern students are connected with people via internet, and social networking sites. In the process, they get fragmented with professors, books, and insightful knowledge. They are overwhelmingly gadget conscious. They give priority to virtually backed up distant relations rather than enjoying the company of their family members and relatives They will slowly ignore familial and societal norms and values. More clearly speaking, they will be more mechanical rather than social.</p>


<h2>Critical thinking</h2>

<h3>a.Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life's most memorable moments? Give reasons in support of your answer. </h3>
<p>Ans. Advancements of technology can enrich a pupil's life in many ways. When students are using technology as a tool or a support for learning with others, they are in an active role rather than the passive role of recipient of information transmitted by teacher, textbook or broadcast. They are actively making choices about how to generate, obtain, manipulate or display information. Technology use allows many more. Besides, they are thinking proactively about information, making choices, and executing skills than is typical in teacher led-sessions. Moreover, when technology is used as a tool to support learners in performing authentic tasks, the students are in position of defining their goals, making design of decisions and evaluating their progress. Education technology can make learning more interactive and collaborative. This can help the students to engage with course materials more effectively. They learn by doing instead of memorizing facts from books.</p>
<p>But the advantages of technological advancement should not mask the drawbacks of the same. For instance, the learners miss the real experience of life and cognitive power to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>They may lose their analytical innate knowledge if they do not interact with teacher or friends. They may not be familiar with textbook and its theme.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we must consider both of the above-stated perspectives while meditating on the issue of our discussion.</p>

<h3>b.	Kline's essay focuses on the contrast between her son's freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.</h3>
<p>Ans.	Kline's essay focuses on contrast between her son's freshman college experience and her own. In her time, there weren't many facilities in the college. She was unaware of the social currencies being exchanged around her. He had never seen fanciest car and she felt hesitation to ask the way around the college periphery. There only were typewriter, carbon papers telephone with curly curds and T.V. with a few channels and no remotes. But her son was very lucky. Because he has internet facilities. He can search route of the campus area in google map. Every room, timetable and reading class are exposed in the net. He could make friends within a minute. Hayden can get every information in Internet He has laptop, computer, iPad, smart and phone. He is familiar with digital era.</p>
<p>However, the mother and the son have some things in common as well. The first similarity is that both of them are first-year students at university. Their college is also same. He is also away from his hometown for study like his mother. The rooms of the college, physical appearance, playground and blocks of college are same. All the students are unfamiliar. Like his mother, he doesn't have any experience of college life. </p>
<h3>c.	Has internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers? How?</h3>
<p>Ans.	Internet has proved boon to us in some regards. One of such fascinating usages of this technological innovation is boosting of critical thinking Plainly stating, critical thinking is the ability to carefully evaluate and think about the information presented to us. Correct facts foster one's critical thinking level. The ability to fact check is much easier with the internet than without. Furthermore, it allows students to look beyond the four walls of the classroom. They become highly critical of the information they receive. They analyze information. They even challenge the ideas given by their teachers or elders. They can critique their own knowledge too.</p>
<p>Moreover, they can learn new perspectives of looking at a problem. They can grasp more than their textbook can teach. In this regard, internet has aided to broadening and enhancing the critical thinking capacity of readers.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the text</h2>
    <h3>Answer the following questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	Where did the children use to play?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The children used to play in the Giant's beautiful garden. <br><br>
        <strong>b.	What did the Snow and the Frost do to the garden?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>As soon as the winter approached, the Giant's garden was no longer beautiful. The snow covered up the grass with great white cloak and the frost painted all the trees silver. Even after the arrival of the spring all over the country, his garden still looked miserable: it was awful with no singing of birds and blossom of flowers. The snow and the frost invited the north wind as well as the hail to the Giant's garden. In the absence of the playful children, they were the only people pleased in the garden.<br><br>
        <strong>c.	What did the giant hear when he was lying awake in bed?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>When the Giant was lying awake in the bed, he heard some beautiful music of a little linnet.<br><br>
        <strong>d.	Why do you think spring season never came to the giant's garden?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Spring season never came to the Giant's garden because he didn't allow the children to play there. I think nature wanted to teach the selfish and rude creature a lesson.<br><br>
        <strong>e.	How did the giant realise his mistake?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The Giant saw his garden becoming lifeless on account of his selfish act of depriving children of their fun. The garden coming back to life miraculously in the presence of the little boy and other children made him realise his mistake.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>A.	Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow. </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	"How happy we were there!" they said to each other.</strong><br>
        <strong>i.	Where does 'there' refer to? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"There' refers to the garden. <br><br>
        <strong>ii.	What does 'they' refer to?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"They' refers to the children. <br><br>
        <strong>iii. 	Why are they saying so?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The Giant doesn't allow them to enter into his garden. As a result, they are missing their playground and sweet fruits. <br><br><br>

        <strong>b.	"I have many beautiful flowers," he said; "but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all." </strong><br>
        <strong>i.	Who is the speaker?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The Giant is the speaker.<br><br>
        <strong>ii.	Who is he speaking to?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The speaker is speaking to himself.<br><br>
        <strong>iii.	Who are the children' that the speaker is referring to?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>He is referring to the children who used to play in his garden. <br><br>
        <strong>iv.	Why is the speaker saying that the children are the most beautiful flowers of all"? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>His garden became like a paradise once the children were back. The giant is making the comparison between the flowers and the little children. Accordingly, both are the valuable and inseparable members of his garden. Both make his place exciting and cool. Hence, the giant compliments the children calling them the most beautiful flowers of all.<br><br><br>

        <strong>c.	When the little child smiled at the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise," shortly afterwards, the happy giant dies. What is the coincidence of this event? Describe it in relation to this fairy tale.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The above given lines are extracted from a children's story entitled "The Selfish Giant' by an Irish author, Oscar Wilde. The story, which comprises the element of both fairy-tale and fantasy, teaches an important lesson on the significance of love and sharing. <br><br>
        The given lines appear at the last stage of Wilde's story. It reveals the conversation between the giant and the little boy, who is Christ in disguise. After hearing these words from the boy, the owner of the property passes away. It seems as if Jesus Christ has come to receive the old landholder safely to heaven. The latter is blessed with the visit of God for his selfless love and sharing. The Giant acquires peaceful death.         
    </p>
    <h3>B.	The story makes use of personification as one of the main figures of speech. Cite three examples of personification from the story. What is the significance of the seasons personified in the story?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Personification is a figure of speech in which human qualities are given to non-human entities, such as animals and objects, and abstract concepts (like love). In Wilde's story, the flowers, trees, seasons, and other aspects of nature, such as wind, snow, hailstorm, etc. are presented as human beings. Through personification, the author fills life into the non-human organisms by making them emotionally sensitive and intellectually insightful. By doing so, the writer asks us to appreciate the value of nature. Moreover, the readers will have a transparent understanding of the story content. 
    </p>
    <h3>C.	This story can be read as a fairy-tale, where the children, the seasons, the tree, the corner of the garden, the snow, the wind and the frost are all used as symbolism. Interpret those symbols.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Wilde's story is rich in symbolism. The Giant, the children, the seasons, the tree, the garden, the corner of the garden, the snow, the wind, the frost and the little boy are the well-noted symbols in the text. In this regard, the Giant symbolizes the obsessive mentality of the humans, as they think they can survive independently on their own and they don't need others. Similarly, the children stand for innocence and love. The garden also reflects the innocence of the children. But with the presence of the Giant, it also signifies the journey that a person's soul undertakes in order to find redemption. Spring is a symbol of happiness. Summer and autumn also refer to delight. On the other hand, the unpleasant cold winter is a symbol of suffering and evil. The tree is the symbol of patience. The corner of the garden represents heaven. The snow, the wind and the frost are presented as the agents of evil, who inflict destruction in the human world. The little boy is Christ, dressed like a poor and weak child, who has come to teach the Giant some lessons about life and guide him to redemption.
    </p>
    <h3>D. 	Which figure of speech is used for winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little child"? Who is the little child compared to?</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Both symbolism and personification are used for 'winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little child'. The little child is compared to Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	What is the main theme of this story?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The main theme of the story includes humanity, salvation, compassion, kindness, arrogance, loneliness, love and pain.<br><br>
        <strong>b.	Does God punish those who are cruel to children and very selfish?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Based on Wild's story, we can say that God punishes those who are cruel to children and very selfish. Jesus is shown to have penalized the selfish Giant for his ill treatment of the innocent children. However, with a remarkable improvement in his character and an appeal of apology, the culprit is forgiven at the end of the story and given place in heaven.        <br><br>

        Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American writer, poet, literary critic and editor. Poe is best known for his
        poetry and short stories. He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United States and of
        the American literature as a whole. He is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction and further
        credited with contributing to the eme 15 emerging genre of science fiction. He is famous for his dark,
        mysterious poems and stories, including The Raven, The Black Cat, The Fall of the House of Usher, and Heart. His
        tale The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) initiated the modern detective story, and the atmosphere in his tales
        of horror is unrivalled in American fiction. His The Raven (1845) is among the best-known poems in the national
        literature. <br><br>
        'The Oval Portrait' was first published as a longer version titled 'Life in Death' in Graham's Magazine in 1842.
        The shorter version, renamed 'The Oval Portrait' was published in the April 26, 1845 edition of the Broadway
        Journal. This is the story of an artist who wants to make a painting of his young wife, but becomes so obsessed
        with it that he doesn't realize his wife is dying meanwhile. This is a short horror story about the relationship
        between art and life, through the narrator's encounter with the oval portrait of a young woman in a chateau in
        the Apennines.

    </p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <p>

        <strong>b.	"The Oval Portrait" is a short horror story by Edgar Allan Poe involving the disturbing circumstances surrounding a portrait in a chateau. Elaborate.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"The Oval Portrait' is a short classic western horror story, by the father of modern horror literature, Edgar Allan Poe. Known as the master of American Gothic literature, Poe composed numerous dark and mysterious poems and stories, including The Raven, The Black Cat and The Fall of the House of Usher. "The Oval Portrait' was first was first published the 1845 issue of The Broadway Journal. Having a Gothic undertone, the story magnificently explores a complex relation between art and life. Themes of death, hopelessness, dark and gloomy tone, madness and Gothic setting gives Poe's story a horror tale.<br><br>This story makes a portrait its chief subject matter of horror. The picture appears in one of the darker corners of the mysterious room. The psychic narrator cannot tell with certainty when www.ceram whether it is an image or a real-living person. The real taste of horror overtakes the readers when we are told that the portrait was the outcome of an obsessive painter, who compelled his wife to die for the creation of the painting.

        <strong>d.	Discuss the story as a frame narrative (a story within a story).</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"The Oval Portrait' is a frame story (story-within-story). Poe has served the two parallel tales in this story. The bigger story or the outermost story retells the narrative of the narrator, who was badly injured because of some unspecified reason, and his manservant, Pedro, make a forcible entrance into an abandoned chateau in the Apennines, a mountain range in central Italy. Similarly, the art book's writer's narrative, the inner story, focuses on the painter and its subject. The author tells how a naturally cheerful maiden of rarest beauty married a painter who was extraordinarily passionate about art.<br><br>
        <strong>e.	The story is told in a descriptive style, with plenty of imagery and symbolism. Which images and symbols do you find in the story? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>We can trace various images and symbols in the story. The abandoned chateau, the night setting and the mysterious painting are the images of Gothic tone. The young girl is the symbol of an innocent victim. Similarly, the painter is the symbol of obsession. He is also the image of a vampire. The portrait is the symbol of immortality of art.<br><br>
        <strong>f.	What does the expression "She was dead!" mean? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The expression signifies the painter's shocking realization about his subject's death. He exclaims because of her unexpected demise at the hand of his obsession and passion. He had brought a life into death for the sake of art. By using capital A in art, Poe has personified the lifeless art, in the process, giving it higher position than life.<br><br>

    <p>
      <strong>a.	Do you think there is life in art?</strong><br>
      <strong>Ans. </strong>Life and art are interrelated terms. The former creates art; the latter makes life more meaningful. As art is made by life, I strongly believe that some part of it in artistic creations, like painting, music, pottery and so on. <br><br>
      <strong>b.	As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. Explain. </strong><br>
      <strong>Ans. </strong>It is said that a painting can tell a thousand words. As a matter of fact, painting is a very special form of art. It involves the process making an image on paper or canvas. The artists fill life into it, which impacts our thoughts and emotions directly. It can touch us in many ways.<br><br>
      <strong>c.	A more intense look at the painting reveals the illusion. Have you noticed any such painting? </strong><br>
      <strong>Ans. </strong>Yes, I have noticed such painting. It was the portrait of Icarus falling into the sea by Brueghel. I came to make meanings of many illusive ideas expressed in that painting after having a deep observation of the same. One of such discoveries was the illusion of indifference and inhumanity.<br><br>

    <h1>3. God Sees the Truth but Waits</h1>
    <p><i>- Leo Tolstoy</i></p>
    <h2>Before Reading</h2>
    <h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	What does the title of the story mean?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The title of the story holds a deep and indirect meaning. On a simple level, it implies that God knows all the truths but lets humans find out on their own. The readers are left with the question: why does He wait even after knowing the real truths? It seems to mean that there is a reason for such a holdup. Moreover. God needs enough time to reveal the facts.<br><br>
        <strong>b. 	Is it fair to punish the innocent people in the name of justice? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>It is not fair to punish people for the crimes they have not committed.<br><br>
        <strong>c.	Do you believe dreams might predict the terrible fate of a person? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I do not believe that dreams might predict the terrible fate of a person.<br><br>

        <strong><i>Leo Tolstoy</i></strong> (1828-1910) was a Russian writer and a master of realistic fiction. He was born in a wealthy family in Russia. His parents died when he was a child. He was brought up by his elder brothers and relatives. He studied languages and law at Kazan University for three years. He was dissatisfied with the school and left Kazan without a degree. Then he returned to his estate and educated himself independently. <br><br>
        In 1848, he moved to the capital, St. Petersburg, where he passed two tests for a law degree. He took military training and became an Army officer. He wrote his first novel Childhood (1852), which became a success. With writing Boyhood (1854) and Youth (1857), he concluded the autobiographical trilogy. He also wrote Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. He primarily wrote novels and short stories. Later in his life, he also wrote plays and essays. He is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). His fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886). Family Happiness (1859), and Hadji Murad (1912) During his last three decades, Tolstoy also achieved world renown as a moral and religious teacher. <br><br>
        Tolstoy's short story “God Sees the Truth but Waits first” published in 1872 is about the false conviction and imprisonment of a man for a murder he did not commit, and it takes the form of a parable for forgiveness. <br><br>

        <strong>c.	Why did Aksionov think of killing himself?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The thought of his separation with his wife and children, the pleasant memories with them, and the chains, the convicts during the twenty-six years of his prison life made Aksionov to think of killing himself.<br><br>
        <strong>d.	Why did Makar disclose that he had killed the merchant?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>At first, Makar did not admit his crime of killing the merchant as he had an attitude of not admitting his guilt. However, his heart melted when he heard Aksionov's 26 year-long suffering because of the mischief he had not committed. In addition, Aksionov also forgave Makar despite his unpardonable sins and did not report the latter's secret plan to the authorities.<br><br>
        <strong>e.	Why doesn't Aksionov wish to return to his family at the end of the story? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Askionov does not wish to return to his family at the end of the story because he believes that his wife is dead and his children have forgotten him.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Reference to the context.</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	"Well, old man," repeated the Governor, "tell me the truth: who has been digging under the wall?"</strong><br><br>
        <strong>i.	Who is that old man?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>That old man is Askionov.<br><br>
        <strong>ii.	Which truth is the speaker asking about? <br></strong>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The speaker is demanding to know about the truth related to escape plan. <br><br>
        <strong>iii. 	Which wall does the speaker mean?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>He means the wall of the prison.<br><br><br>
        <strong>b.	Describe Aksionov's character. </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Aksionov is the protagonist of Tolstoy's story. He is a young merchant of Vladimir. The well-to-do man's family consists of his wife and two children at the time of the story's beginning. Before marriage, the popular singer used to drink and get involved in quarrels excessively. He changes himself into a virtuous man after marriage. Over the course of time, he cultivates good qualities such as faith, forgiveness, freedom and acceptance. Being accused of murdering a fellow merchant and robbing him, he has to spend twenty-six years waiting for God's judgement in the prison. As a result of this cold blame, he has to give up all his material possessions and the members of his family. However, he starts understanding human life closely behind the bars. He grows a strong religious devotion for God. The pitiable sufferer breathes his last inside the prison after 26 years of sentence.<br><br><br>
        <strong>c.	What is the theme of the story?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Having a religious tone, Tolstoy's story covers the theme of guilt, forgiveness, justice, faith, conflict, freedom and acceptance.<br><br><br>
        <strong>d.	Which symbols are used in the story and what do they indicate?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Tolstoy's story is rich in its use of the symbols. Aksionov's house and two shops represent his family and material possessions. The prison itself is a symbol of Aksionov's suffering and final spiritual transformation. His grey hair emerges as a clear symbol of his suffering, highlighting not only his aging but also his physical decay resulting from punishment. His grey hair suggests how the stress of his wrongful imprisonment prematurely ages him. The blood-stained knife unpredictably found in Aksionov's bag works as the crucial piece of evidence required to convict him. This knife symbolizes Aksionov's lack of control over his fate. The book 'The Lives of the Saints' Aksionov buys represents his religious devotion.<br><br><br>

    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	What role does religion play in Aksionov's life? How does he undergo a spiritual transformation in the story?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"God Sees the Truth but Waits' can be interpreted as a religious story. Tolstoy makes a statement that a person should always have faith in God no matter how difficult things may for them; they will still be able to forgive another human being for any action taken against them. Religion teaches Aksionov that forgiveness and forgetfulness are the best form of revenge. He also knows about fate, spirituality, God's devotion, righteous path, acceptance, and patience. He undergoes a spiritual transformation from a casual sinner to a pious moral leader.<br><br>
        <strong>b. What does the story tell us about the existence of unfair system of justice? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The story satirizes an unfair system of justice practised by the humans. It is the same system that penalized an innocent man for 26 years without conducting any wrongdoing. The writer argues that human laws have become means of controlling and torturing the common and innocent people. Accordingly, the divine justice is far more superior comparatively.<br><br>

    <h2>Before Reading</h2>
    <h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a. What frightens you? Snakes, spiders, or any other things?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Different things frighten different people. Snakes and dogs frighten me.<br><br>
        <strong>b. What do you do about frightening things: face them or avoid them?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Most of the times, I avoid the frightening things.<br><br>
        <strong>c. Do you have any frightening event in your childhood? Share it with the class.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I was 10-year-old. I was returning home from my school. On the way, I saw a big snake. To
        my terror, it started crawling towards me. I was extremely frightened. I could not decide what to do. So, I
        started crying. Some people heard my terrified screams and ran towards the scene. The snake felt the threat and
        took another way. In no time, it had disappeared in the undergrowth. The crowd consoled me and walked me
        home.<br><br>

        The story The Wish' is about a young boy's fantasy in which his carpet is alive with snakes and fire. Using
        imagery and metaphor. Dahl uses the character of a curiously imaginative young boy to help us reflect on the

    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a. The writer creates two voices in the story. Who are they? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The writer creates two voices in the story: the author's voice and the character's voice.
        The author takes the readers to the imaginative world through the third person narration. On the one hand, he is
        able to use the character of curiously imaginative young boy to help the reader reflect on the delicacy of their
        childhood innocence. Moreover, the child as a major character of the story helps the readers experience the
        world of fantasy vividly. <br><br><br>
        <strong>b. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow. <br> "...the black parts are
            snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks round the middle, and if I touch
            one of them, I'll be bitten and I'll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without being burnt
            and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow."</strong><br><br>
        <strong>i. What does 'the black part' mean?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The 'black part' means poisonous snake.<br><br>
        <strong>ii. Who is the speaker? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The little child is the speaker.<br><br>
        <strong>iii. Why doesn't the speaker want to be burnt? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The speaker doesn't want to be burnt because he is due to receive a puppy for his birthday
        the following day.<br><br><br>
        <strong>c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Dahl has made a very skilful use of images and metaphors in his story. He uses the image
        of a scab to highlight the boy's curiosity. The yellow spots refer to hope whereas the black and red ones stand
        for negative forces or obstacles in his journey ahead. Similarly, the carpet is a metaphor for the challenges
        the boy faces to achieve his goal. The young boy's fear of crossing the carpet is the metaphor of the dread he
        will feel while growing up in real life.<br><br><br>
        <strong>d. Summarise the short story "The Wish" in about 200 words.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>‘The Wish' is a modern western short story by a British novelist, poet. screenwriter and
        short story writer, Roald Dahl. One of the leading authors of children's books. as well as the screenplays, the
        writer is alary known as an author writes humorous fantasy stories. He has written more than 60 short and long
        fictions. Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the Witches and the BFG are some of his celebrated works.
        In The Wish', Dahl makes us conscious about growth in life. with the portrayal of an innocent imaginative young
        boy. It is themed on children's imagination and their psychological growth. <br><br>The story begins on a summer
        day in the protagonist's house with the lead character, who has the birthday next day, picking a scab off his
        knee. After taking out, he casts it on the big red, black and yellow carpet that stretches to the front door. He
        is fascinated by the carpet and decides to play a humorous imaginative game with the same. The game he has
        invented is simple to play: he should cross the carpet without touching the black and red parts. He decides that
        yellow parts are the safe spots whereas the black ones stand for the snakes, which will bite and kill him, and
        the red ones for lumps of coal, which will burn him up completely. He starts his journey carefully. It is easy
        at first, but as he reaches the half way he starts losing his balance and stretches the arms to regain his
        posture. He becomes quite fearful as he takes a bad step ahead. He can't turn back from there. To make it worse,
        the black spots terrify him. He takes another step to the only close yellow piece, and his foot is only a
        centimetre from a black patch. A snake moves and raises its head to watch him. But he mentally assures himself
        by stating that the snake can't bite him as he is not going to touch it. Another snake rises as well, and the
        child is frozen with terror for several minutes. The next step is a very long one as he is forced to jump. He
        manages to get one foot across and transfers his weight. Then he attempts to bring up his back foot but can't.
        He gets stuck and looks down at the oily bodies of the snakes writhing beneath him. In stress, he began to
        wobble, but this time waving his arms only make it worse. He slowly starts to fall towards the black. He starts
        to cry as his hand touches the ground. His mother is looking for him far behind the house outside in the
        sunshine. <br><br>In this way, Dahl focuses on the little boy and his adventure to make points on
        self-confidence and determination to tackle fear. <br><br><br>
        <strong>e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles,
            who presents more interesting or effective view for the readers? Why?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The events in the story are narrated through two perspectives: the narrator's and the
        child'. I think the second voice is stronger, and more interesting or effective as the obvious innocent lens is
        used in unfolding the events. This narrative voice also makes the story suspenseful and catchy.<br><br><br>
        <strong>f. Is "The Wish" a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed? Give your
            arguments.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>In "Wish", Dahl focuses on the power of imaginative adventure to make points on
        self-confidence and determination to tackle fear. To some extent, the author's young protagonist has greed about
        getting a puppy. However, his will to face and overcome the challenges is stronger.<br><br>

    <p>
        <strong>a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Some of our wishes come true whereas some others cannot be fulfilled. It depends on the
        nature of the desire. The wishes involving building castles in the air are unlikely to come true.<br><br><br>
        <strong>b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to
            overcome it?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Different people have different personalities. Some have a pleasant nature while others
        possess brave and cautious characters. Yet some others have a terribly frightening nature. I think a person's
        emotional intelligence impacts his or her nature. The individual who is extremely emotional as well as desperate
        has a frightening nature. I suggest the addressee on building high-esteem to overcome such challenges.
        <br><br><br>
        <strong>c. Write a folktale that you have heard or read.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I have read a classic fairy-tale by Grimm Brothers. It is entitled "The Goose Girl". The
        narrative of the story can be presented as follows: A widowed queen lives with her beautiful daughter, who's
        engaged to a prince in a different land. As the wedding date approaches, the queen puts together a magnificent
        dowry for the girl and appoints a chambermaid to travel with her on the journey to the prince's home. <br><br>
        Before bidding her daughter goodbye, the queen uses a little knife to cut her finger. She lets three drops of
        blood fall onto her handkerchief, and then presses it into her daughter's hands. "Dear child," she says, "take
        good care of this." <br><br>
        The princess and the chambermaid set off on horseback Both princess and chambermaid will ride horses, but only
        the princess's horse, Falada, can talk. After an hour, the princess asks her maid to fetch her a cup of water.
        The chambermaid refuses "I'm not going to wait on you." So the princess dismounts and drinks right out of the
        brook without being able to use the golden cup her mother packed for her dowry. The drops of blood on her
        mother's handkerchief speak aloud: "If your mother knew what was happening, it would break her heart." <br><br>
        Several miles later, the princess is thirsty again. She asks the maid to get her a drink, and again the maid
        refuses. Weeping, the princess bends over to drink from a stream without noticing it when her handkerchief falls
        into the water. But the chambermaid sees the handkerchief fall and rejoices: without it, she knows, the princess
        is powerless against her. When the princess tries to remount Falada, the maid rudely insists that they trade
        horses. Then she forces the princess to change from her fine robes into the maid's plain clothes. Last,
        threatening to kill her, the maid makes the princess swear she won't tell anyone what the maid has done to her.
        Falada, the horse, watches all of this. <br><br>
        On the switched horses, the princess and chambermaid ride to the palace. The prince runs out to greet the maid,
        believing her to be his fiancée. He brings her inside and they marry immediately, leaving the real princess
        standing alone. Just then the old king catches sight of the real princess and marvels at her fine, delicate
        beauty. He asks the chambermaid, now a false bride, about her. She answers, "Oh, I met her on the way here...
        Give her some work to keep her busy." <br><br>
        After some thought, the king sends the princess off to work with a boy named Conrad who tends geese. <br><br>
        Soon after the wedding, the false queen asks her new husband to cut Falada's head off. (She's afraid the horse
        will tell everyone about her.) The real princess, now a goose girl, learns about this and makes a secret deal
        with the knacker: she'll pay him to nail Falada's head to the gateway wall. Whenever the princess and Conrad
        pass through the gateway, she greets the head. The head always answers, "If your mother found this out, there's
        no doubt-her heart would break." <br><br>
        This irritates Conrad, and he's even more annoyed by the fact that the princess never lets him watch her taking
        down her golden hair. Eventually he tells the king he no longer wants to tend geese with the princess. When he
        explains why, the king decides to see for himself what's going on. He hides behind the gateway as the princess
        greets and is answered by the mare's head. Then he steals to the meadow, hides himself again, and watches as the
        princess asks the winds to send Conrad's hat "flying here and flying there, while I comb and braid my hair."
        <br><br>
        The king is naturally intrigued. That night he asks the princess why she behave this way. When the princess,
        distressed, says she's forbidden to explain, the king suggests that she tell her tale to the old iron stove. The
        princess climbs inside and begins her sad story as the King listens through the stovepipe in another room.
        <br><br>
        When he learns the truth about the princess, the king has her dressed in royal garments and then summons his
        son. "The true bride, the former goose girl," he says, is standing in front of the young man who should be her
        husband. The girl the prince married is actually a chambermaid in disguise. <br><br>
        The king holds a great feast at which the real and false princesses sit on either side of the prince. (The
        chambermaid doesn't recognize her former mistress.) After the feast, the king asks the false princess how she
        would punish someone who betrayed a gentlewoman. The unsuspecting chambermaid answers. "She deserves to be
        stripped naked and put into a barrel studded on the inside with sharp nails." Then, she continues, two white
        horses should pull the barrel around until the betrayer is dead. <br><br>
        The king announces that this creative punishment will now be the chambermaid's own. While the chambermaid is
        being put to death, the prince and the true princess are married. From then on, they rule the kingdom in peace
        and joy.

    <h2>Understanding the text</h2>
    <h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	 Why did Jonathan think of himself as 'extraordinarily lucky'?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Jonathan thought of himself as extraordinarily lucky because he survived the Nigerian civil war along with most of his family members,<br><br>
        <strong>b.	What are the ‘five blessings' for which Jonathan is grateful? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Jonathan is grateful for the five blessings: his wife, three children, and his bicycle.<br><br>
        <strong>c.	Why did Jonathan mistrust the officer who wanted to take his bicycle? What does this tell you about the situation in Nigeria? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Jonathan mistrusted the officer who wanted to take his bicycle because the officer easily accepted a bribe in exchange for his bicycle. The policeman, who could not remain untouched by poverty, was not sincere and firm either. It tells us about poverty, corruption and insecurity in Nigeria.<br><br>
        <strong>d. What visitors might be at the door? Are Jonathan and his wife completely surprised? Explain.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The unknown visitors might be the people who had come to rob Jonathan as they might have known about the egg-rasher. The protagonist and his wife are not completely surprised as they have heard about a recent robbery of a commoner in their town.<br><br>
        <strong>e.	Why does no one in the neighbourhood respond when the thieves pound on Jonathan's door? Why do the thieves call for the police?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>No one in the neighbourhood responds when the thieves pound on Jonathan's door for fear of their lives. The thieves called for the police because they knew that the terror-stricken neighbours would not turn up to support Jonathan's family. They wanted to make fun of the sufferers' appeal.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	What does Jonathan mean by his expression "Nothing puzzles God"? What does this expression reveal about his character? Explain by citing details from the story.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>'Nothing puzzles God is a refrain in Achebe's story 'Civil Peace'. Jonathan repeats this statement four times. The protagonist's catchphrase reflects his ability to move forward without being consumed by darkness. Moreover, it indicates his deep religious faith in God. It also shows his optimism and hope. Accordingly, God is everywhere and He is not surprised by anything. To conclude, this phrase refers to the gains. losses, and value of life. This expression establishes Achebe's main character as a fatalistic and hopeful person. He hopes for better tomorrow rather than mourning the losses in the past.<br><br><br>
        <strong>b.	How does Jonathan change as he experiences the conflicts in his life? Explain. </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Jonathan is a movable character. His personality changes as much as he encounters bitter experiences during the Nigerian Civil War. To be honest, the conflict turns him into a hopeful, peace-loving and hardworking man. He maintains cool composure during the adverse time. Besides, he prioritizes his family and work to the lamentation of losses. <br><br><br>
        <strong>c.	Read the extract and answer the questions below. <br>"To God who made me; if you come inside and find one hundred pounds, take it and shoot me and shoot my wife and children. I swear to God. The only money I have in this life is this twenty pounds egg-rasher they gave me today…”</strong><br><br>
        <strong>i.	Who is the speaker?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Jonathan is the speaker.<br><br>
        <strong>ii. Who is the speaker talking to?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>He is talking to the thieves.<br><br>
        <strong>iii. Who does "they" refer to?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>“They" refers to the government.<br><br><br>
        <strong>d.	Nigerian English has words like soja 'soldier' and katakata 'confusion', 'trouble' derived apparently from English words but transformed by native languages' phonologies. What does the author's use of dialect here add to the story?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Achebe uses Nigerian English to present the original African voice. By focusing on the native language, he attempts to promote local dialects. In the process, he raises a strong voice in preserving African cultural heritage. The dialects also help to present the actual character and life of Nigeria. In this regard, the writer seems to maintain his patriotic stance in his writing.<br><br><br>
        <strong>e.	Why do you think the thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with at heavier African accent than Jonathan does?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does. The first reason for such differences may be the fact that Jonathan is more educated and civilized than the former group. Similarly, heavy African accent advocates for true Africanis, as the use of broken English accurately reflects eastern Nigerian society. Moreover, by giving more privilege to African dialect, the writer attempts to set up superiority and powerfulness of African culture. Such usage arouses comic effects too. <br><br><br>
        <strong>f.	The title of the story "Civil Peace" itself is ironical as there is little to differentiate "civil peace' from 'civil war'. Do you think that the title of this story is appropriate, or would "Civil War" have been a better title? Explain.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Achebe's story demonstrates the similarities between Nigeria during the Civil War and after the War. The title of the story is quite ironic since the setting is still full of violence and disorder. I think the title of the story is suitable. It is because the writer's argument becomes much clearer and sharper with the use of ironic rather than a dull straightforward title. Additionally, the writer has focused on the optimistic future rather than the tragic past in the story. To present ‘hope’, ‘peace’ will be a better term than ‘war’. To sum up, the sarcastic topic is quite appropriate to highlight the violence still present in post-war Nigeria.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a.	How would you describe the civil peace in Nigeria?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>'Civil Peace brings to the fore the absence of civility in post-war Nigeria. Moreover, the situation of the Civil peace in Nigeria wasn't up to the mark yet. People still lived-in fear as they had to face various problems after the war. Corruption and theft were still prevalent. The government had failed to maintain rule of law as well as peace and order in the society.<br><br>
        <strong>b.	What kind of attitude towards life do you think you would have if your situation was similar to that of Jonathan's?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>If I was in a similar situation to that of Achebe's protagonist, I would be desperate and hopeless. I would have gone far away from the war-affected region to save me and my family. I would not have the courage of Jonathan. <br><br>
        <strong>c.	Draw the character sketch of Jonathan Iwegbu.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Jonathan Iwegbu is the lead character of Achebe's short story. He has survived the Nigerian civil war, along with his wife and three of his four children. In the present, he faces the uncertain future with enthusiastic optimism. He gives thanks for what he has rather than regret what he has lost. He counts all the blessings he has been given, chief among them his family, and after that, his scant material possessions, his bicycle and his home. He uses these possessions to immediately begin rebuilding his life, the bicycle becomes a taxi, and the house becomes a bar. The one thing that Jonathan cannot cast a positive light on is the thieves' assault; however, he still never complains about losing twenty pounds, a significant sum. Instead, the next moming finds Jonathan, and his family, hard at work again, already looking ahead to the future. In this way, the writer has portrayed Jonathan as a positive character.<br><br>

    <p>
        <strong><i>Guy de Maupassant</i></strong> (1850-1893) was a popular 19thcentury French writer. His short stories
        are characterized by their economy of style and their efficient effortless dénouement. His stories are linked by
        irony and the frailty of human nature. He was an author of the realist and naturalist schools of writing. He
        wrote novels, poetry and newspapers articles, but he is best known for his short stories in the field of
        literature. <br><br>
        The story Two Little Soldiers' is about a triangular love with a completely unexpected twist at the end. This
        story shows the compatibility of friendship and romantic love with change, discontent, conflict., betrayal and
        jealousy.

    <h2>Understanding the text</h2>
    <h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a. Why do the two soldiers spend their free time on Sundays away from the barracks out in the
            countryside?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Maupassant's male leads, Luc Le Ganidec and Jean Kerderen, are two French soldiers and
        very good friends, who adore spending their weekends together away from their barracks and urban setting. The
        countryside destination reminds them of their homes. They are attracted to the fields, the hedges, the forests,
        and beaches. However, the centre of their attention is the dairy maid from the village of Bezons. <br><br>
        <strong>b. Why does the girl become the topic of conversation for these soldiers? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>One of the centres of attraction in the two French soldiers' outing is a tall young
        village girl. The beautiful country maid brings her cow out to pasture every week at the same time. They start
        conversing about her as both of them are secretly in love with her.<br><br>
        <strong>c. Why does deception enter into their friendship?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Luc Le Ganidee starts seeing the country maid without Jean's knowledge. Hence, love for
        the girl is responsible for the entrance of deception into their friendship.<br><br>
        <strong>d. Do you think that Luc is a betrayer of friendship?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>I feel Luc is a great betrayer of friendship. He puts the friendship built in trust at
        risk for the sake of a newly found girl. Moreover, his dishonesty and deception also costs the life of an
        innocent person, in addition to their friendship.<br><br>
        <strong>e. What is the cause of suicide of Jean? Do you think that it was the only release of his
            love?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The secret betrayal, on the hand of Luc and the village girl, is the cause of Jean's
        suicide. I think it was the bitterness of both friendship and love, which led to such tragic
        consequence.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a. What is the central theme of the story?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The central theme of this story is love and friendship. The writer wishes to show that
        friendship becomes fragile in the presence of love.<br><br><br>
        <strong>b. "What are you doing here? Are you watching the grass grow?"</strong><br>
        <strong>i. Who is the speaker?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The village milkmaid is the speaker.<br><br>
        <strong>ii. What does the word "here" indicate?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"Here" indicates the pasture in the countryside, where the two Bezons soldiers are
        spending their day off.<br><br>
        <strong>iii. Who does "you" refer to? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>"You" refers to the two French soldiers.<br><br><br>
        <strong>c. "He leaned-he-he was leaning-so far over-that his head carried him away and-he-fell--he
            fell-"</strong><br>
        <strong>i. Who is the speaker?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Luc is the speaker.<br><br>
        <strong>ii. Why is the speaker speaking with interruption?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The speaker speaking with interruption because he is devastated by the untimely death of
        his friend, which was caused by his insensitiveness and deception.<br><br>
        <strong>iii. What does he mean when he says "he-fell-he fell--"?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>He means to say that Jean fell into the stream.<br><br><br>
        <strong>d. Two Little Soldiers' can be viewed as a series of dramatic scenes. Describe the story as tragedy.
        </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Two Little Soldiers' is a modern western short story, by a French novelist, poet,
        essayist, travel writer, short story writer and author. Guy de Maupassant. It is a tragic love story involving
        three people. The plot ends with the separation of two good friends: Luc and Jean. Similarly, the love story
        between the village girl and Jean does not produce good results, thanks to the betrayal of the girl in question
        and Luc. Most importantly, an innocent person has to become the victim of dishonesty in friendship and love. All
        these elements establish Maupassant's story as a tragedy.<br><br><br>
        <strong>e. What is the setting and style of the story?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Two Little Soldiers' is a modern western short story, by a French novelist, poet,
        essayist, travel writer, short story writer and author. Guy de Maupassant. The majority of the story takes place
        in Courbevole, a town in the countryside of France. The time setting of the story is not specified. The writer
        has adopted a realistic writing style. His subjects are real common day subjects, like soldier, war, love,
        friendship, jealousy, and deception. He uses the omnipresent narrator to serve the best angle possible to
        narrate the realistic descriptions.<br><br><br>
        <strong>f. How would you describe the conflict between the friends?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>‘Two Little Soldiers' centres on the conflict between two good friends, Luc and Jean.
        Maupassant relies on the psychological conflict rather than the physical one. The entrance of a woman becomes
        the main cause of this sort of silent mental hostility. Luc betrays the bond of friendship to win the lady. As a
        result, a fierce internal bitterness prevails in the relationship between the male lovers, which breaks their
        friendship. Luc's attempt to access the girl costs a friendship and a life.<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>a. Is it good to have conflict between friendship and love? Is it morally good that a person and his
            best friend can love the same person?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Maupassant's story describes a conflict between friendship and love. One has to sacrifice
        the former for the sake of the latter, exemplified by Luc in the story. In the triangular love relationship, the
        third person can suffer if two attendees start maintaining hidden enterprise. The writer suggests that a person
        and his best friend cannot love the same person. Otherwise, tragic consequences, like the ones in the story, may
        take place.<br><br>
        <strong>b. How would you describe the triangular love? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>‘Two Little Soldiers' is a modern western short story, by a French novelist, poet,
        essayist, travel writer, short story writer and author, Guy de Maupassant. One of the major areas of the
        writer's focus is the triangular love. It is clear that the author is not a great fan of such a story. In the
        triangular love relationship, the third person can suffer if two attendees start maintaining hidden enterprise.
        The writer suggests that a person and his best friend cannot love the same person. Otherwise, tragic
        consequences, like the ones in the story, may take place. Hence, honesty is a must in a relationship, whether it
        is two-faceted or triangular.<br><br>

        <strong>Ans. </strong>The astrologer's forehead is covered with sacred ash and vermilion. He wears a
        saffron-coloured turban on his head. His eyes sparkles abnormally which is the result of continually looking for
        clients and customers. The power of his eyes to attract people is also due to their positioning between dark
        whiskers and a painted forehead. He helps the customers satisfy their needs with his working analysis of their
        troubles like marriage, money, etc. He is able to please them because of his clever guessing.<br><br>
        <strong>b. How do you characterise the astrologer's attitude toward the stranger? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The astrologer is calm, observant and deceptive character. When he is about to wind up his
        business, he meets a rogue character, Guru Nayak who is a part of his past life. The astrologer sees the
        stranger before him and takes him to be his possible customer. <br><br>
        <strong>c. What details does the astrologer give the stranger about his past? </strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>He tells the visitor that he was stabbed by a knife and thrown into a well to die, and

        <strong>d. Why does he advise the stranger to go home immediately?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The astrologer tells the stranger to take the next train to home and do never venture into
        town again. He gives this piece of advice as a means of self-preservation. He recognizes the newcomer as the man
        he tried to kill after a drunken quarrel decades ago. <br><br>
        <strong>e. What is your reaction to the conversation between the astrologer and his wife?</strong><br>

    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a. Suspense is the feeling of anticipation you may have as you read. In this story, what details
            contributed to your feelings of suspense and surprise? Explain.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>This is a suspenseful story. We can trace out some elements of suspense in the narrative.
        The feeling of suspense is created about the personal and past life of the astrologer. The reader is told that
        he was not intended to be an astrologer. He left his village without any previous plan. The reader is also told
        that astrology is not his family business. This creates curiosity in the mind of the reader about the reason why
        he broke this ancestral cycle and was forced him to leave his home all of a sudden. The sense of suspense
        continues with the astrologer's encounter with the stranger. The astrologer catches a glimpse of the stranger's
        face in the flash of light created by the matchstick, and immediately disagrees to accept the stranger's
        challenge. At the end of the story, the reader is surprised with revelation of the fact that the astrologer was
        the person who stabbed the stranger and left for dead when he was drunk during one of his days as a
        youngster.<br><br><br>
        <strong>b. Analyse the conflicts in "An Astrologer's Day." Explain how the conflicts are resolved and what they
            reveal about the characters involved in the story.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Conflict is the problem that the characters face throughout the story that keeps the plot
        moving. It allows us to go deep inside the characters and relate to how they feel and problem they face.
        <br><br>Both internal and external conflicts can be noticed in the story. The first conflict occurs when a
        stranger appears in the scene as the astrologer's client. The astrologer is packing up his stuff and ready to
        call it a day. The stranger challenges. the fortune teller to provide specific answers for his questions. As the
        stranger lights his cheroot, he catches a glimpse of his face by the match light and for some unclear reasons
        the astrologer feels uncomfortable and rejects the challenge. But he is forced to tell the stranger something
        that will satisfy him. The stranger is surprised to be told about his past life by the astrologer, and agrees to
        give up his search for his enemy who was declared to have been crushed under a lorry. The astrologer ensures a
        safe and secure life for himself hereafter.<br><br><br>
        <strong>c. "All right. I will speak. But will you give me a rupee if what I say is convincing? Otherwise I will
            not open my mouth, and you may do what you like." </strong><br>
        <strong>i. Who is the speaker?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The astrologer is the speaker.<br><br>
        <strong>ii. Who is he speaking to?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>He is speaking to the stranger.<br><br>
        <strong>iii. What does the expression 'open my mouth' mean?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The expression 'open my mouth' means to speak some information about the
        stranger.<br><br><br>
        <strong>d. Description helps readers visualize what is happening in a story. What details and techniques does
            the author use to describe the astrologer?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>R. K. Narayan brings many images, smells, textures, vendors food, and crafts clothing
        through his impressive descriptions. The main character is not given a name, but the writer gives many other
        details to describe him. He is portrayed as an intelligent, clever and hardworking person. The author describes
        how he begins his business. He removes all his professional equipment like cowries' shells, charts, Palmyra
        writing, etc. He is also dressed typically like an astrologer to attract customers. His forehead is bright with
        sacred ash and vermilion. His eyes are assumed to have a prophetic light by his customers. He wears a saffron
        turban Thus, the astrologer presented himself so perfectly that he was consequently a point of attraction for
        all the people.<br><br><br>
        <strong>e. Irony is a contrast between appearances and reality. What is ironic about Guru Nayak's meeting with
            the astrologer?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Irony is a literary device which is used to refer to a situation which differs from the
        expected meaning. The irony of the situation, in this story, centres around the fact that Guru Nayak comes to
        the astrologer for help in finding and killing the very man he is talking to. The stranger comes to the
        astrologer for help in finding and killing the man he is talking to. The man whom Guru Nayak is looking for is
        none other than the astrologer himself. As soon as the astrologer recognizes the man, he feels very
        uncomfortable. But the astrologer wisely misinforms him. He makes Guru Nayak wait and bargain for money. he
        finally calls the stranger by his name and tells him about the incident that happened in the village, he has
        Guru Nayak in the palm of his hand.<br><br><br>
        <strong>f. How does the astrologer's manner of dress suit his character?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The astrologer is the main character of R. K. Narayan's present story. The author has
        created the description of his protagonist's different aspects in the way to match his character. He describes
        the outfit and the appearance that the astrologer carries when he performs his duty. He is dressed typically
        like an astrologer. His forehead is bright with sacred ash and vermilion. He winds a saffron-coloured turban
        around his head. His dress and appearance suit his character and becomes a centre of attraction. They are easily
        fooled by the astrologer with his wits. He is intelligent and has his shrewd ways to go about his profession. He
        has a working analysis of mankind's troubles.<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a. The astrologer attracts many customers in the street who are pleased and astonished by what he tells
            them. What does this tell you about the people of the town walking in the street?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>The astrologer tries to impress the people by telling their fortune about what is going to
        happen in the future and what had happened in the past. He is very famous for his wit along with satisfactory
        fortune-telling quality. People follow his predictions and instructions blindly. This tells me that they are
        fatalistic and religious. In addition, they always spend their lives following others instead of trusting
        themselves. They are more worried about the past and the future than the present.<br><br>
        <strong>b. Why do most people want to know their future? Do you think astrologers can really help them know
            their future?</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Astrology is the belief that the alignment of stars and planets affects every individual's
        mood, personality and environment depending on when she was born. Astrologers print horoscopes that are
        personalized by birth date. These horoscopes make prediction about people's personal lives. Scientists tell
        astrology doesn't work, but the believers disregard the formers' allegations. <br><br>According to
        psychologists, human beings constantly seek narratives to help weave their past, present and future together
        through their goals and expectations. They want to know about their future to satisfy themselves. Moreover, they
        love to hear about their future success. Their curiosity drives them the most towards astrological
        predictions.<br><br>
        <strong>c. Is astrology a good practice of fortune telling or is it just a blind faith? Give
            reasons.</strong><br>
        <strong>Ans. </strong>Astrology is the belief that the alignment of stars and planets affects every individual's
        mood, personality and environment depending on when she was born. It could be one of the oldest existing pattern
        recognition models Even though derived from real data, the hypothesis of this science is mostly flawed. That is
        to say, celestial arrangement has got nothing to do with what your future holds. I think it is just a blind
        fate. Nobody can know about the future of an individual.<br><br>

    </p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>a. What does the speaker mean when he says:</h3>
    <p>But have you ever counted <br>
        How many have died so far<br>
        Because of you and your wars?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>These beautiful lines have been taken from Vishnu S. Rai's wonderful poem "Corona says”.
        Here, we find Corona as the main speaker who is talking to a man of the present world. The speaker says to the
        addressee about the bad aspect of war and thinking of superiority possessed by him. He wants to make the man
        realise about the impacts of inhumane wars. The speaker is blaming human beings for killing many people through
        their wars. He is asking about the calculation of the number of war-borne deaths.</p>
    <h3>b. Explain the following:</h3>
    <p>I will depart one day.<br>
        But remember<br>
        There're many others like me.<br>
        They'll come too.<br>
        If you don't get rid of your inflated ego,<br>

        That you endured<br>
        Long, l o n g, l o n g ago …
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>These lines have been adopted from Vishnu S. Rai's wonderful poem 'Corona Says'.
        Here, we find Corona as the main speaker, who is talking to a man of the present world. Here, the speaker is
        warning the human about future circumstances. He is informing him about his fellow living creatures, who are
        similar to him. He says that one day he will depart from the planet but if humans don't get rid of their
        inflated egos, other similar viruses will keep appearing, thereby forcing them to go back to the caves as
        before. That will be the worst situation for the sufferers.
    </p>
    <h3>c. What does the speaker mean in the following lines? Explain.</h3>
    <p>The earth is not your property alone -<br>
        It's as much ours as yours.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Here, Corona is making the human realise that the earth belongs to all the creatures, not
        only the humans. Moreover, he means to say that the earth isn't their property alone. Every creature residing on
        this planet has the right to survive. Corona is asking us to keep our ego at check.
    </p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. What human behaviours are responsible for the suffering in people's lives?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Human behaviours are the sole causes behind all these sufferings of the people. Due to
        human egos and bad deeds, the present world is facing a crisis. Many people have lost their lives during this
        critical period. Due to their selfish nature, the earth and the creatures living on its lap have faced numerous
        problems of disease. Their ego and war for capturing nature has snatched the lives of many people.</p>
    <h3>b. How does an epidemic differ from pandemie? Briefly explain the impact of Corona Virus on human life and
        environment.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>An epidemic is a widespread disease that affects many people in a population. In contrast,
        a pandemic is a disease that affects a wide geographical area and a large proportion of the population.<br><br>
        Corona virus is considered as one of the unforgettable threats of the twenty-first century. This disease has
        taken the lives of people at a very high level. People in the world are panic-stricken and fearful. Covid-19 has
        created devastating results in human's history. Due to this pandemic, people are seen sanitizing the environment
        every time.<br><br>
        In the poem's final lines, the speaker gives an important warning to mankind. Accordingly, if they don't change
        their ways, there will be a huge problem that could push civilization all the way back to cave. Human beings
        should learn the lesson from this poem and change their behaviour.

    <p>Robert Burns (1759-1796) was a Scottish poet and lyricist. He is considered the national poet of Scotland and a
        central figure in Scottish literature. His father was a tenant farmer. and Burns worked as a plowboy. He grew up
        poor but well-read and began writing poetry in the Scottish dialect. As an adult, he was as unsuccessful as his
        father in making a living at farming.<br><br>
        In 1791, however, he quit farming for good and moved his family to the nearby town of Dumfries. Never in good
        health, on the morning of July 21, 1796, he died in Dumfries at the age of 37.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/Poem_chapter2.JPG"> He
        is best known as a pioneer of
        the Romantic Movement for his lyrical poetry.<br><br>
        The poem 'A Red, Red Rose' is a lyrical ballad that describes the speaker's deep love for his beloved and
        promises that this love will last longer than human life. The beloved of the speaker is as beautiful as the red
        rose and as sweet as the music. With the help of literary devices, the poet has sketched a very vivid and
        realistic picture of his profound love.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the text<br><br>
        Answer the following questions.
    </h2>
    <h3>a. To which two things does the speaker compare his love in the first stanza?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The speaker presents two similes: the first one, comparing his love to a red rose and the
        second one comparing his love to a melody.</p>
    <h3>b. What does the speaker promise in the second and third stanzas?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>He promises lo love her for eternity (until the seas and oceans go dry).</p>
    <h3>c. What imagery does he use in his promise, and why do you think he uses such language?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Burns has used the visual imagery in his poem. He uses the image of 'seas getting dry' and
        'rocks melting in his promise. He applies these images to give the sense of infinite or everlasting love.</p>
    <h3>d. In the last stanza, what event is about to happen by mentioning the number of miles?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In the last stanza, the speaker is about to forsake his dear for a short time. He also
        means to indicate that his lover will get aged soon. However, distance (the number of miles) and her old age
        will not be the obstacles/excuses in his love for her.</p>
    <h3>e. Which image in the poem do you find the most memorable or surprising and why?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>I think the image of red rose is the most memorable and surprising Burns employs the red
        rose to represent the love between the speaker and the beloved, which in turn is the central focus of the poem.
        Moreover, the flower of the writer's preference binds all the other images (drying seas, melting rocks, and
        sands of life) used in the ballad. In a way, the speaker has used all of the images, except rose, to show
        transience and impermanence of love. The image of rose is surprising because it signals contradiction: the
        graceful rose's rapid decay as a contrast to his eternal feelings for the beloved.</p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>a. What can you infer about the speaker's devotion to his beloved from the following lines? And I will come
        again, my love, Tho' it were ten thousand mile!</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The above given verses are extracted from a classic western romantic poem titled 'Red, Red
        Rose' by a Scottish poet, lyricist and author, Robert Burns. The source poem covers multiple themes, including
        love, beauty and age. The extracted lines appear in the last stanza of Burns' poem. In this text, the speaker
        bids farewell to the beloved, as he is intending to undertake a brief journey away from his desire of heart. The
        beloved doesn't need to worry, though, because the speaker promises to return, even if the journey is "ten
        thousand mile[s]" long. This promise implies that, just as long stretches of time could not exhaust the
        speaker's love for the beloved, a long stretch of distance cannot keep the speaker from her. He means to say
        that his love is so strong that the earthly obstacles (like physical distance) will become trifle.</p>
    <h3>b. What is the theme of the poem?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The central theme of the poem 'Red, Red Rose' is love.</p>
    <h3>c. Paraphrase the whole poem into simple prose form.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The speaker's love is like a newly bloomed red rose and a sweet melody of musical
        instrument. His beloved is so fair that he is in a profound affair with her and he will also continue to love
        her until the seas become dry. He will give her his company till the rocks melt and life becomes a wasteland.
        Finally, the lover takes al temporary leave from his lass promising to return even if he has to cover a distance
        of ten thousand miles.</p>
    <h3>d. Literary devices are tools that enable the writers to present their ideas, emotions, and feelings and also
        help the readers understand those more profound meanings. Analyse the poem in terms of the literary devices such
        as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Burns' poem is full of literary devices. The most prominent device of all is simile. It is
        a figure of speech which indirectly compares one thing with another thing of a different kind, using the words
        'like' or 'as'. "O my Luve is like a red, red rose", "O, my love is like the melody" and "As fair art thou, my
        bonny lass" are three instances of simile used by the poet. In these three verses, the poet compares his love to
        a red rose, a melody of a song and an attractive woman respectively.<br><br>
        Similarly, symbolism refers to the use of the symbols to signify ideas and qualities, giving them symbolic
        meanings different from their literal meanings. The writer has used the symbol of a red rose to signify a
        romantic love between him and his beloved. He employs the rose's beauty as an image of the beloved and uses the
        rose's rapid decay as a contrast to his or her eternal feelings for the beloved.<br><br>
        Imagery refers to the writer's use of vivid images to portray some ideas, qualities or phenomena. Burns has
        applied visual imagery in the poem such as, "O my Luve is like a red, red rose"." And the rocks melt wi' the
        sun" and "While the sands o' life shall run".<br><br>
        Alliteration is the repetition of the same consonant sounds in the same verse. In "O my Luve is like a red, red
        rose". "T' and 'r' are repeated twice and thrice respectively.<br><br>
        Assonance is a literary device that shows the resemblance of sound between syllables of the words which are
        closer. It usually involves repeating vowel sounds in the nearby words. The sound of /i/ recurs in "I will love
        thee still, my dear".
    </p>
    <h3>e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In the simple language, hyperbole is a figure of speech involving the use of exaggeration
        in the text. It is used to overemphasize a statement in the sentence. Burns has used hyperbole in the last line
        of the second stanza. "Till a' the seas gang dry." He says that his love will flow even when the seas dry up.
        The second is used in the third stanza, "And the rocks melt wi' the sun." The writer aims at immortalizing the
        love with the help of hyperbole in this poem.</p>
    <h3>f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>A refrain is a line or lines that are repeated in poetry. The line, "And I will luve thee
        still, my dear" has become a refrain, as it has been repeated in second and the third stanzas. Similarly, "Till
        a' the seas gang dry' is also used twice (in the 8th and the 9th line).</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. What kind of love is expressed in "A Red, Red Rose"?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>A Red, Red Rose’ is a classic western romantic poem by a Scottish poet, lyricist and
        writer, Robert Burns. A romantic form of love is expressed in this poem. In the first stanza, the poet maintains
        that his love is beautiful as a rose and sweet as al melodious tune, but is aware that both will lose their
        touch in no time. In the remaining three stanzas, however, he emphasizes the immortal nature of his love.
        Anyway, the poet expresses an intense and passionate admiration for the lady of his heart's will.</p>
    <h3>b. Do you think that love has power? Why do the poets compose poems addressing their beloved?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Fairly speaking, love is an emotion. However, it is not an ordinary feeling, rather it is a
        potent force. Robert Bum's classical lyric "A Red, Red Rose' also establishes love as a positive vibrant, which
        has arrested the entire attention of the persona. He argues love as a magnificent, omnipotent and eternal
        sensation. Resembling the Scottish poet, an American inspirational speaker and writer, Steve Maraboli, has
        portrayed the prowess of love as: "I believe in the immeasurable power of love, that true love can endure any
        circumstance and reach across any distance." The poets compose poems remembering their loved ones as they are
        positively and creatively influenced by the charm and enigma of the latter.</p>
    <h3>c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Poetry is a special genre of literature. It is regarded as the highest literary form, for
        its application of exceedingly sophisticated and figurative language and literary devices. The poets use it as a
        tool for evoking feelings and emotions, such as love. A renowned English romantic poet, William Wordsworth, has
        defined poetry as "the spontaneous overflow of feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in
        tranquility." This definition also upholds poetry's identification as the expression of emotional responses. One
        can argue that poems allow us to release our pent-up emotions and thoughts through written words. It engages our
        mind, pleasing us aesthetically in turn.</p>

        William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English poet, dramatist and actor of the Renaissance era. He is widely
        regarded as the greatest writer in English language and the world's greatest dramatist.<img
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/Poem_chapter3.JPG"> His most famous works
        include Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth. This poem is taken from William Shakespeare's
        play As You Like It. With these words “all the world's a stage” begins the monologue by the character Melancholy
        Jaques in Act II Scene VI of the play. In this poem, Shakespeare has compared life with a stage. The seven
        stages of a person's life are infant, school going boy, lover/husband, soldier/fighter, justice/ ability to
        understand the right and wrong, Pantalone (greediness and high in status) and old-age., which can come into your
        mind when you go through this poem with the theme that a person is the ultimate loser in the game of life.

    <h2>Understanding the text</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. Why does the poet compare the world with a stage?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The poet compares the world with a stage because accordingly, the world looks like the
        platform on which men and women enact different acts.</p>
    <h3>b. What is the first stage in a human's life? In what sense can it be a troubling stage?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The first stage in a human's life is infanthood. In this age, the baby vomits in the arms
        of his nurse and to be in the comfort of his mother (difficult to persuade); hence this part of human life can
        be considered troubling.</p>
    <h3>c. Describe the second stage of life based on the poem.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The second stage depicts boyhood, in which the person plays the role of a school boy. He is
        unwilling to go to school and take the responsibility of being a student.</p>
    <h3>d. Why is the last stage called second childhood?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In the last stage, a person loses his ability to see, hear, feel, smell and taste, exactly
        like an infant. Moreover, he becomes dependent on others like a child. This is why
        this age is called second childhood.</p>
    <h3>e. In what sense are we the players in the world stage?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to Shakespeare, human life is a play and everyone is a character/player in it.
        From the birth (entrance) to death (exit), they perform many acts, like the players of a drama. In this sense,
        we are the players in the world stage.</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the context </h2>
    <h3>a. Explain the following lines:</h3>
    <p>All the world's a stage,<br> And all the men and women merely players</p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The above given lines are extracted from a classic western poem entitled ‘All the World's
        Stage' by an English poet, dramatist and writer, William Shakespeare (1564-1616). The author is regarded as the
        greatest English dramatist in the world. Some of his famous works consist of “Hamlet”, “The Merchant of Venice',
        and “Romeo and Juliet'. The poem of the above title is extracted from Shakespeare's
        famous comic play entitled “As You Like It'. In the above extract, the writer has compared the world with a
        drama stage by using metaphor. He thinks the world is a stage as it looks like the platform on which men and
        women enact different acts. All the human beings are referred to as the characters of the drama, which is human
        life.</p>
    <h3>b. Explain the following lines briefly with reference to the context. <br><br>They have their exits and their
        entrances;<br> And one man in his time plays many parts,</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The above given lines are extracted from a classic western poem entitled “All the World's
        Stage' by an English poet, dramatist and writer, William Shakespeare (1564-1616). The author is regarded as the
        greatest English dramatist in the world. Some of his famous works consist of “Hamlet”, “The Merchant of Venice',
        and “Romeo and Juliet'. The poem of the above title is extracted from Shakespeare's famous comic play entitled
        “As You Like It. In the above extract, the writer has compared the world with a drama stage and people with the
        actors of the drama. Accordingly, they have their exits and entrances in the world. Here, entrance means birth
        whereas exit signifies death. During the interval of the birth and the death, men and women play seven roles
        (infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, judge, old man:
        and second childishness).</p>
    <h3>c. Read the given lines and answer the questions that follow.<br><br> Then the whining schoolboy, with his
        satchel<br> And shining morning face, creeping like snail <br>Unwillingly to school.</h3>
    <p><strong>i. Which stage of life is being referred to here by the poet?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Childhood is being referred to here by the poet.</p>
    <p><strong>ii. Which figure of speech has been employed in the second line?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Simile has been employed in the second line.</p>
    <p><strong>ïïi. Who is compared to the snail?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The schoolboy is compared to the snail. This analogy implies that the school goer
        walks as slowly as a snail.</p>
    <p><strong>iv. Does the boy go to the school willingly?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>He is unwilling to go to school and take the responsibility of being a student.</p>
    <p><strong>v. Simile and metaphor are the two major poetic devices used in this poem. Explain citing examples of
            each.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Shakespeare has compared the world with a drama stage by employing two major literary
        devices: simile and metaphor. Both of these tools are employed to draw an analogy between two unlike terms.
        Simile involves indirect comparison (by the use
        of the words 'like' and 'as') whereas metaphors explicit analogies. We can trace the following instances of
        these two literary devices in the poem:<br><strong> Similes:</strong><br> 1. “And shining morning face, creeping
        like snail” <br>2. ^ "Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,” <br><strong>Metaphors:</strong><br>
        1. “All the world's a stage” <br>
        2. “And all the men and women merely players” <br>3. “Seeking the bubble reputation”<br>4. “His youthful hose,
        well say’d, a world too wide”<br> .
        5. "and his big manly voice, turning again toward childish treble”</p>
    <p><strong>vi. Which style does the poet use to express his emotions about how he thinks that
            the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Shakespeare uses a narrative style to express his emotions about how. he thinks that
        the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players.</p>
    <p><strong>vii. What is the theme of this poem?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The theme of this philosophical poem is the human lifecycle. Describing the seven different
        stages of human life, the poet argues that life is nothing but a drama.</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. Describe the various stages of a human's life picturised in the poem “All the
        World's a Stage.” </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to Shakespeare, men and women play seven roles (infant, schoolboy, lover,
        soldier, judge, old man and second childishness) during the interval of the birth and the death. The man begins
        his act on the stage as an infant; he pukes in the arms of his nurse and cries to be in the comfort of his
        mother.<br><br> The second stage depicts boyhood, in which the person plays the role of a school boy. He is
        unwilling to go to school and take the responsibility of being a student.<br><br> The third stage brings before
        us an adolescent lover who sings sad and romantic ballads for his beloved. In the youthful age when man is full
        of energy and might, he may do everything to please his beloved.<br><br>
        The next age is that of a young soldier. He regards his oaths to his state with his life, is proud of his honor
        and quick in battle. Reputation, jealousy and honour is very important for him.<br><br>
        The fifth stage picturizes a middle-aged judge in round belly. His eyes are severe and his beard is of a formal
        cut. He is full of wisdom and modern examples where they are relevant.<br><br>
        The sixth act is that of old age in which a man becomes thin, eyesight is weakened and he turns into a child
        once again. The once roaring and manly voice of the soldier and the authoritative voice of the justice reduces
        in pitch and volume, becoming something akin to child-like in the old man. His voice whistles as he
        talks.<br><br> According to the writer, the last scene is that of the Second Childishness, characterized by
        oblivion, where none of our six senses work and we are left devoid of everything. As a result, he becomes
        dependent on others like a child. Finally, a person's life ends with his death, which occurs in this particular
        part.</p>
    <h3>b. Is Shakespeare's comparison of human's life with a drama stage apt? How?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong> ‘All the World's Stage' is a classic western poem by an English poet, dramatist and
        writer, William Shakespeare (1564-1616). The author is regarded as the greatest English dramatist in the world.
        Some of his famous works consist of “Hamlet”, “The Merchant of Venice', and “Romeo and Juliet'. The poem of the
        above title is extracted from Shakespeare's famous comic play entitled “As You Like It'. In the poem, the writer
        has compared the world with a drama stage. I think this comparison is appropriate.<br><br> Every person's life
        in the world begins as an infant, with birth. S/he undergoes multiple changes in the due course from that point
        onwards. As one changes from one part to the other, s/he performs different roles as described in Shakespeare's
        extract. Since the world becomes the ground on which human beings perform their parts as per the demand of the
        different ages, we can compare it to the drama stage on which the actors perform their respective roles.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 4 - Who are you, little i ?</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- E. E. Cummings</p>
    <h2>Before Reading</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer these questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. Have you ever looked out through a window and taken pleasure in what you
        saw? If so, what did you look at?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Yes, indeed. Once I looked out through a window of my living room and saw a beautiful
        parrot.</p>
    <h3>b. Which beautiful scenes do you think would make you want to look out through the window?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>I think the natural scenes (for example, lake, trees, birds, animals, etc.) would make us
        want to look out through the window.</p>
    <h3>c. Do you write the pronoun ‘l' capital or small in writing?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In writing, we write capital “I'.</p>
    <p>E(dward) E(stlin) Cummings (1894-1962); often styled as e e cummings, was an American poet, painter, essayist,
        novelist, and playwright. He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and<img
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/Poem_chapter4.JPG">
        several essays, as well as numerous drawings and paintings.<br><br> He developed the style of poetry writing for
        which he became renowned, with its unconventional use of capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and structure. He
        is regarded as an eminent voice of the 20th century English literature.<br><br> Cummings' poem 'who are you,
        little i' describes a child looking out a window at the end of the day. It is about nature and the effect it has
        on the speaker. The speaker of the poein is the person “voicing” the words, recalling a childhood moment closely
        connected with nature. Perhaps the speaker is Cummings.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the text </h2>
    <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. Who can be the speaker of this poem?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The poet himself can be the speaker of this poem.</p>
    <h3>b. What is "little i” doing?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The "little i" is looking out through a window at a sunrise.</p>
    <h3>c. What can be the relationship between "little i” and the speaker of the poem?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The speaker and “little i” can be the two parts of the same person. Clearly stating,
        the poet is the grown-up version of “little i”.</p>
    <h3>d. What is the speaker remembering from his childhood days in the poem?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>He is remembering a childhood moment closely connected with nature.</p>
    <h3>e. What attitude does the speaker seem to have toward the child in the poem?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>He seems to have a positive attitude towards the child. He is pleased in relishing the
        delights of childhood innocence and natural beauty.</p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>a.
        Why do you think Cummings has placed a semicolon between the words window and at? </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Most probably, he has placed a semicolon between the words 'window' and 'at' to separate
        the poem into two parts. We can say so, since a semicolon is used to mark a breakage of two sentences. In this
        regard, he gives us a hint at two sections of the poem: in the first section, the poet asks his question; in the
        second part, he goes on to describe the sense of wonder he has experienced.</p>
    <h3>b. If the speaker is the child grown up, why does he ask, “who are you”?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>He asks this question to be sure if the child is really his own younger version or not. It
        is because his present life is not as pleasing as the young boy's; hence he is taking sometime to convince
        himself.</p>
    <h3>c. In this poem, an adult reflects on the childhood experience. Based on that, what might be the theme of the
        lines: “(and feeling: that if day / has to become night/ this is a beautiful way)”?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The theme of the extracted lines might be ‘death'. We can guess that the adult man is
        counting his days in the world. However, instead of being scared of death (day becoming night), he welcomes it
        in relief thinking that his suffering would end
        soon.</p>
    <h3>d. What is the rhyme scheme used in the poem?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The rhyming pattern used in the poem is: ABABCDCD.</p>
    <h3>e. Explain the pun in "little i” that is related to what he is doing.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>A pun is a figure of speech which involves the clever use of a word in a sentence
        to convey another meaning. In this poem, “little i” acts as a pun. The poet wishes to relate two meanings from
        the same. It refers to a specific part of the poet's personality. But it also makes reference to seeing the
        world through the perspective of a child.</p>
    <h3>f. How does Cummings's use of lowercase letters affect your understanding of the poem? Explain. </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Cummings is known for the unconventional use of capitalization, punctuation, spacing, and
        structure in his writings. In this poem also we can see him using lowercasė letters throughout (no periods also,
        except in ‘November'. He has chosen this style to discourage emphasis. Moreover, he thinks all the letters are
        of equal importance. He even does not capitalize l’ to maintain humility: Use of small letters gives the feeling
        of equality. It gives less value to the self and promotes the time (capitalization used in the time phrase).</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. How does nature inspire the speaker in “who are you, little i”? Explain.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>This poem has established Cummings as a nature poet. He is positively influenced . by the
        same. His fascination with ecology is huge. It inspires him to relive his
        peaceful childhood. It also makes him forget the present suffering.</p>
    <h3>b. Recall a childhood moment when you felt closely connected with nature.
        Describe the time and place as well as your feelings and thoughts about it.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The memories of playing hide-and-seek in the tea garden, with the friends back to my
        village, are still fresh in my mind. Even though time has changed me into an adult, those youthful experiences
        enhanced by nature still live inside me. The nine year old me would venture into the tea garden with some kids
        of my age and disappear into the amusing park for hours. The scene would hold us spellbound. The pleasant smell
        of tea leaves added to the beauty of the paradise. Sometimes, old-me wishes to go back to that part of the
        village and vanish into the mesmerizing setting.</p>
    <h3>c. Interpret the poem in any way you like.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>‘Who are you, little i?' is a modern western poem by an American poet, painter, essayist,
        novelist, and playwright, Edward) E(stlin) Cummings. The writer has 'composed almost 2,900 poems, two
        autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. This poem can be interpreted as the celebration of
        natural beauty. The poet uses nostalgic tone as he remembers his childhood days decorated by the beauty of
        nature.<br><br> He used to be amazed by the charm of nature. He asks "Who are you, little i?". because it has
        been a long time since he has experienced this childlike sense of wonder. In this way, he relishes the delights
        of childhood innocence and natural beauty. He is happy for possessing the youthful spirit in himself to this
        day. The poet admits that thinking about the beauty of nature, such as this magnificent sunrise, is a "beautiful
        way" to live life and to keep away the darkness. Instead of being scared of death (day becoming night), he
        welcomes it in relief.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 5 - The Gift in Wartime</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Tran Mong Tu (translated by Vann Phan)</p>
    <h2>Before Reading</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer these questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. Have you ever experienced the death of someone close to you? If yes, how did
        you feel?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Yes, I have. I had a very hard time dealing with my emotions when my father expired. I was
        terribly saddened and grieved.</p>
    <h3>b. Is war always destructive?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>War is a situation involving a conflict between countries or groups of people, usually with
        the use of weapons. Most of the time, it is destructive and unpleasant. However, some wars, like the ones fought
        for reasons are constructive and justifiable.</p>
    <p>Tran Mong Tu was born and grown up in Hai Dong, North Vietnam in 1943. She worked for Associated Press in South
        Vietnam in the 1960s. She moved to the US in 1975 after South Vietnam fall. Tran had wanted to be<img
            src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/Poem_chapter5.JPG"> a writer since
        elementary school, but her poetry was not published until she reached the United States.<br><br> Today, she
        frequently contributes poems and short stories to Vietnamese literary publications in the US and other
        countries. “War is a terrible thing,” says Tran, who has first-hand experience of the Vietnam War (1954-1975).
        According to Tran, “The Vietnam War is a shameful experience, for both Vietnamese and Americans.” Many people in
        both countries felt the terrible tragedy of the war. Losses in the war were heavy; more than two million
        Vietnamese and 57,000 Americans died.<br><br> In the poem 'The Gift in Wartime', Tran addresses an absent
        person. For example, as she says, “I offer you roses,” the person to whom she is speaking is not present and can
        neither hear nor understand what she is saying.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the text </h2>
    <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. Who is the speaker addressing and why can that person not hear or understand what she is saying?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The speaker is addressing her lover. He cannot hear or understand her as he has already
        passed away while fighting in war.</p>
    <h3>b. What can you infer about the speaker's feelings for the person addressed as “you”?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>I can infer that the speaker is deeply saddened because of the demise of her addressee. She
        is having a tough time to control her emotions. As a result, she has come to her lover's tomb to offer her
        admiration for him.</p>
    <h3>c. What is the speaker's attitude toward war?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>She is furious at war as it deprived-her of the most precious presence of the 'you'. She
        badly criticizes the culprit.</p>
    <h3>d. In what ways do you think this person's fate has affected the speaker?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The addressee had promised to give her togetherness for the whole life. However, his early
        demise at the hand of merciless war left the vow shattered. At present, she misses his presence. He is
        restricted to the memories. Instead of a promising future, this relationship has pushed her into loneliness and
        indifference.</p>
    <h3>e. What does the speaker promise at the end of the poem? Why do you think the speaker does this?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>At the end of the poem, the speaker promises to catch up with her sweetheart in the next
        life. She does this because she is not able to forget him. She wishes to immortalize her love for the person she
        likes the most.</p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>a. What is the theme of the poem? </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>War is the major theme of the poem. Love is also an equally prominent idea of the
        text.</p>
    <h3>b. What imagery from the poem made the greatest impression on you? Why?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Tran's poem is full of images related to war and love. Roses, wedding gown, tomb with green
        grass, medals, clouds, dress soaked in blood, the lifeless body and shrapnel are some obvious examples of
        imagery used in the poem. Among these, imagery of shrapnel made the greatest impression on me. I think the
        object of my choice expresses the bitterness of war most clearly. This image indicates that war has broken the
        speaker's life truly reflected by the tool to inflict the same.</p>
    <h3>c. Which figurative language is used in the poem? Explain with examples.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>We can trace some examples of figures of speech in Tran's poem. The clearest of all is the
        imagery. This poem is full of images related to war and love. Roses, wedding gown, tomb with green grass,
        medals, clouds, dress soaked in blood, the lifeless body and shrapnel are some obvious examples of imagery used
        in the poem.<br><br> The poet has utilised irony too. The title 'The Gift in Wartime’ expresses a satirical view
        concerning the advantages of war. Accordingly, war bestows people with amazing gifts, such as pain, suffering,
        separation, etc.<br><br> One can also notice two instances of anaphora (repetition of the same words at the
        beginning of lines) too. “You give me” and “I offer you” are repeated thrice (each) in the poem.</p>
    <h3>d. What does the speaker “offer” in this poem? What does the person addressed as "you” give in return?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The speaker offers roses, her wedding gown, her youth, clouds and cold winters. The
        addressee gives her the medals with shining stars, badge with yellow pips, the smell of blood from wardress,
        lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight, and body without motion.</p>
    <h3>e. An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker addresses an absent person or an abstract
        idea in such a way as if it were present and can understand. Discuss the poem in relation to apostrophe.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Tran has applied different literary devices in her poem. Apostrophe is one of them. The
        author has not used it as a punctuation mark in this poem, rather she applies it as a proper literary device.
        This usage allows her to address an abstract subject, like the absent lover, directly. A noted website clarifies
        this stance further: “The effect of an apostrophe in poetry is to personify or bring to life something not
        living, so the poet is able to address it directly. This puts the subject in a form to which the reader
        relates.” Hence, the apostrophe has helped the writer to converse peacefully and fluently with a non-existent
        person as if he was around her.</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. One way to get relief from grief is to write or talk about it. In your opinion,
        how might the speaker in this poem have benefitted from saying what she did? Explain. </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong> It is said that one of the best ways to heal emotional wounds is to bring everything out.
        To put it in another way, communicating helps in easing some uncomfortable emotions. Once we share our pent-up
        feelings, we will feel better inside. Perhaps it is the same with the speaker. She is greatly troubled by the
        loss of her loved one at - the hand of brutal war. She is trying to deal with her grief in any way she can.
        Writing has become a great platform to do so as she will be sympathised by the readers who have also lost many
        relatives during wartime.</p>
    <h3>b. Write an essay on the effects of war.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: The Effects of War</strong><br>A very ancient Dutch philosopher once remarked: “War is delightful to
        those who have had no experience of it.” A very thoughtful statement indeed. This comment is enough to mark the
        impact of war in human life. The problem with this proclamation, however, is that it ignores the positive
        consequences war can bring about. <br>The effect of war can be manifold. It impacts individuals, groups,
        nations, as well as overall international systems at social, cultural, ecological, economic and psychological
        levels. Some individuals have to die in war. Others sustain permanent injuries. Either way, their families are
        left with abundant materials to grieve or mourn the rest of their lives. In addition, war hampers social
        cohesion and the feeling of universal brotherhood. Economy of the defeated nation suffers hugely. Sovereignty
        and independence is at stake. Political instability is likely to take over. The relation between or among the
        communities or nations are severed.<br> War can influence positively too. Firstly, the weak and problematic
        governance systems can be eliminated. Educational, medical and technical progress can be mapped too. Employment
        opportunities can also foster.<br> In this way, war has many negative effects in human life. But we can't ignore
        some positive impacts of the same either.</p>

    <h3>a.

        Do you share your cultural traditions with your friends?
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Cultural traditions include events, rituals and customs that a society shares.

        They are important because they transmit shared values, stories and goals from one generation to the next. I
        share cultural traditions, like norms, values, food, dress, festivals and rituals, with my friends. I tell them
        about my family traditions and

        know from them about theirs as well.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Did your parents tell you stories when you were a child? If yes, did they have. anything to do with your
        culture or values?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>My parents told me many stories when I was a child. They meant to teach me the value of
        culture through oral tradition. Their major goal was to preserve culture and tradition b n by y means of oral
        storytelling. </p>
    <h3>c. Should we preserve our cultural values and traditions? Why?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Cultural values and traditions are our identities. Moreover, they reflect our history and
        culture. In their absence, our identities are in crisis. Hence, we should preserve i
        them.

    <h2>Understanding the text </h2>
    <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. According to LaPena, what is the importance of the oral tradition? To what extent do you agree with his
        opinions and why?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to the writer, oral tradition occupies a special place in our life. He considers
        its role in connection to maintaining the values of culture. Stating simply, LaPena argues that oral tradition
        helps to preserve and maintain the culture and values of our tradition. Cultural and traditional values play
        very significant roles in our lives as they reflect our culture and civilization. Hence, I agree with the
        author's opinions.</p>
    <h3>b. Who preserve and pass on the oral tradition?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong> Both the elders and young people preserve and pass on the oral tradition. Putting

        clearly, the former group pass it to the younger generations to be continued.
    </p>
    <h3>c. What is the danger of not passing on information from generation to

        generation?
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The danger of not passing information down from generation to generation is that

        the culture and values of our tradition will disappear. We have to live a worthless life in the absence of
        culture and tradition.
    </p>
    <h3>d. What is the difference between oral tradition and literary tradition?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>An oral tradition is a form of art in which information related to culture and values is
        transmitted from one generation to the next generation through oral means. One can correct mistakes orally at
        any time in this tradition, unlike in the literary tradition. Moreover, the values of oral tradition are
        successfully transmitted from person to person. In contrast, the deviation of people's thought misinterprets
        real

        aspects of values in some cases of literary tradition.
    </p>
    <h3>e. How does La Pena establish a relationship between art and the oral tradition?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>LaPena believes that art and oral tradition share some close bondage. Accordingly, the oral
        tradition is a form of art. Information related to traditional myth, ethics, social norms and values is
        communicated artistically through oral speech, folktales, ballads, songs, prose-verses, etc. Oral tradition is a
        unique art whereby the culture and values of tradition are preserved and upheld in the world.</p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>a. LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. If you believe that the oral
        tradition is important, how would you maintain it? </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. I would

        do the same by means of the following:<br><br>
        <li> Conveying information about culture, social norms and values through speeches</li><br>

        <li>Making people aware about the importance of oral tradition.</li><br>

        <li>Organizing a team in our locality to support oral culture.</li><br>
        <li> Listening to folklores, folk songs, ballads and verses regularly.</li><br>

        <li>Analysing the folktales told by the elders. </li><br>
        <li>Sharing information about my family traditions with others.</li>

    </p>
    <h3>b. "Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders." Explain this statement with reference to the
        essay.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The given extract is drawn out from a modern western essay entitled "Sharing Tradition" by
        an American essayist, lecturer and writer, Frank LaPena. This essay focuses on the importance of passing on the
        traditions orally and the value of keeping a culture alive. According to the writer, not everyone can fulfill
        the roles of the elders. Moreover, the older generation plays a prominent part in maintaining and protecting our
        tradition. The elders are the ones who preserved and transferred the traditions to the newer generations. The
        essayist thinks that performing the duties of keeping religion, culture, tradition and history alive cannot be
        done by immature hands. That's why, it is hard to fill in the places of such ideal visionaries.</p>
    <h3>c. What is the controlling idea or thesis of this essay?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Sharing Traditions" is a modern western essay by an American essayist, lecturer and writer,
        Frank LaPena The author primarily drives our attention to the importance of tradition for the people of this
        world and its preservation through the oral tradition. The essay discusses the process of sharing tradition by
        oral means. It even advocates the most suitable way of passing it from one generation to generation. Both the
        elders and the younger generations play their respective parts in preserving the oral tradition. In the process,
        both of the groups contribute in conserving the culture and values of social rules and norms.</p>
    <h3>d. How do topic sentences guide the reader through the essay? What would be lost without them?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>
        The most important sentence of the paragraph, which usually precedes all other sentences, is called a topic
        sentence. Such statement helps to organize the entire paragraph. In providing the main gist, topic sentences
        guide the readers through various ideas discussed in the paragraph When it comes to LaPena's essay, these
        sentences have helped in portraying the importance of oral sharing tradition. They do so by keeping the audience
        alert on the values of the tradition. They basically teach the addressees to maintain and preserve the oral
        traditions. Besides, they contribute in building support to the theme of the text. In their absence following
        controlling ideas will be missed out:<br>
        <li>Concept of the oral tradition</li><br>

        <li>Oral tradition and its importance. </li><br>
        <li>The role of the elderly and youth.</li><br>

        <li>Problem in the preservation and conservation of oral tradition.</li><br>

        <li>Solution for maintaining oral tradition.</li>
    </p>
    <h3>e. What are the four major problems developed by LaPena with regard to maintaining the oral tradition. How are
        they used to structure the essay?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The four main issues developed by LaPena regarding maintaining oral tradition are: <br>
        <li>Difficulty in filling the elder's niche with the problem of sharing traditions through verbal tradition</li>
        <br>
        <li>The influence of modern technology</li><br>

        <li>The effect of the modern educational system. </li><br>
        <li>Information sources and how to recognize and share them.</li><br>

        <li>Lack of patience on the part of the listeners</li><br>

        These problems are presented to strengthen the writer's major thesis the importance of tradition for the people
        and its preservation through the oral tradition. LaPena uses this aspect to show that the said-conservation is
        not going to be easier on account of the listed dilemmas.
    </p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. Write a paragraph or two explaining your attitude toward the oral tradition of passing along information.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Oral tradition is one of the effective practices for sustaining and preserving the culture.
        It is a valuable tradition for all the people of this world. I also accept oral tradition as an art form. Both
        elderly and young people play vital roles in preserving and maintaining culture and traditional values by
        passing an authentic information from generation to generation. For everyone, the practice of oral tradition is
        very important. We can preserve and keep our cultural and traditional values through oral continuation. We can
        secure our cultural and traditional identity with the help of oral transmission.</p>
    <h3>b. Our culture is our identity. Write a few paragraphs explaining how you intend to preserve your culture,
        values and norms.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Our identity is our culture. In our lives, culture, values, and norms play a very
        significant role. Needless to say, a person's whole life depends on his/her culture, which is the mirror to view
        civilization. It goes without saying one's culture is the guiding principle of his her life. In this regard, our
        lives will become meaningless if the traditions and values are ignored.<br>

        I intend to preserve my culture, values and norms by performing the following activities:
        <li> Celebrating every ceremony linked to my culture.
        </li><br>

        <li>Making people aware about the significance of our culture, values and standards.
        </li><br>

        <li>Advertising or promoting cultural and traditional events in my society.
        </li><br>

        <li>Forming an organization related to cultural heritage.
        </li><br>

        <li>Sharing culture related information and the values of my tradition.
        </li>

        Live Before You Die". The speaker maintains that time moves in one direction so we can't really predict things.
        But we are able to understand it in hindsight. Some things in life happen haphazardly. We just generalize a
        person with history of his parents and family background but life's course may change in a minute. He suggests

        inner voice. And most important, have this courage to follow your heart and intuition." motivating us to utilize
        the time we have in positive endeavours.</p>
    <h3>c. What does he mean by "don't settle"?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In his 2005-commencement speech, titled "How to Live Before You Die," Steve says, "Don't
        settle". He means to say that we should keep looking for what we love to do. Moreover, we should not be
        satisfied with our achievements. Instead, we should strive for more great deeds. He stresses that the only way
        to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. He inspires us by saying that we have to keep
        ourselves busy with innovative mind and expanding work. We don't know when we die. Hence, we should keep moving
        in search of our love with the limited time given to us.</p>
    <h3>d. Which style of speech is used by the speaker to persuade the audience?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Steve Job's commencement speech details his chaotic story of adoption, his time at Reed
        College and his cancer diagnosis. The speech has personal or informal style. He tells the story his life. In the
        process, he provides some inspirational anecdotes. His personal story and advice will have a huge impact on the
        readers, who have some real-life issues to be tackled in their daily life. He uses direct. speech to show that
        he really cares for his addressees.</p>
    <h3>e. It is not easy to motivate others. How do you think Steve Jobs' speech is so inspiring?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Honestly speaking, it is not easy to motivate others. Motivation depends on many factors.
        For instance, we are likely to get inspired from the people who have achieved something in their own lives. Jobs
        was a great personality, who built an empire of success through his visionary dreams and hard works. From his
        personality, we can learn that success does not come overnight; it is an outcome of a series of positive
        hardships. His speech is so inspiring because the speaker has got enough credibility to make the delivery. That
        is to say, he has shown that everyone is capable of chasing their dreams through timeless efforts and toil.
        Moreover, his superior skill with presenting and public speaking was a key factor in his success. He speaks in a
        natural pace without rushing through materials.</p>
    <h3>f. Why do you think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative story telling technique in his speech? What influence
        does it have on the audiences?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Even though the presentation lacks statistics and data, Jobs creates a psychological
        contract with his audience through personal and intimate storytelling. The readers are likely to entertain soft
        facts more than hard data. Besides, they will appreciate and resonate with the personal stories and anecdotes.
        This causes his audiences to reflect and take action. He speaks for common values, goals and ambitions. He has
        clear vision of life. He inspires us not to settle before death since we don't know when it comes to us.</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. One of Steve Jobs mottos was: "Think differently. Can this make a person succeed in life? What challenges are
        there in thinking differently?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Steve Jobs inspires us to build innovative thinking to achieve something in life. I
        personally feel that thinking differently can help a person to succeed. It is because once we think differently
        from others, newer findings are likely to appear in the world. One should always strive to bring about novel
        inventions. The people who think, however, are likely to be highly critical of the present knowledge. Moreover,
        they might be unnecessarily negative about the world.</p>
    <h3>b. What does the slogan "Stay hungry; stay foolish" mean to you?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The slogan "Stay hungry, stay foolish" is an encouragement to keep one's mind open. It
        suggests us to be like a child, who isn't spoiled by a rigid mindset. If we are hungry and foolish, we are
        willing to work and learn. So, Jobs was asks people to be willing to learn new things. In this phrase, he
        purposefully uses negative adjectives in a positive way. This is what gives this phrase its punch.<br><br>
        'Hungry, here, means wanting something more, as in "he was hungry for a raise". Jobs is putting forward that
        being dissatisfied with what you have and wanting more is a good thing.<br><br> Likewise, someone who is foolish
        acts without thinking Jobs is saying that one should take stupid risks.<br><br> Putting together, the speaker
        maintains that we only live once, so we should make it count and go after what we want. Hence, the phrase
        motivates us positively about learning.</p>
    <h3>c. What does it mean to be a visionary? What makes Steve Jobs different from a fortune teller?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Steve Jobs wasn't an engineer or a designer. But he was one of the greatest users of
        technology of all time, and that made all the difference. He is considered as a visionary legend because of his
        place in the history of computer design. Steve collaborated with Wozniak to establish Apple computer company.
        They saw transformative nature of the computer before many others. The speaker, in particular, was able to
        anticipate how the computer would and could drive the future. He didn't care much about reality. He focused on
        the innovation through which he revolutionized the world with the inventions like, a personal computer, iPod,
        iPhone and iPad. Steve is a role model for many struggling entrepreneurs, business leaders, college-dropouts and
        disease-fighting people.<br><br> He doesn't believe in fate and fortune teller. He believes in work of
        invention. He isn't scared of death. Though he has severe cancer, he doesn't stop his creation. In each and
        every challenge, he sees an opportunity, so he becomes successful in life.</p>

        genetics, evolutionary biology, and mathematics. His formal schooling was done at Eton College and New
        College<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampokharasahitey/englishapp/main/Essay_chapter3.JPG">
        at Oxford. He obtained his M.A. in 1914. Soon after, Haldane enlisted in the British Army and served during
        World War 1. After returning from the war, Haldane began his teaching career at University.<br><br>

        Haldane's first paper in 1915 demonstrated genetic linkage in mammals. Haldane was a professed socialist,
        Marxist, atheist and humanist. His political dissent led him to renounce his British citizenship in 1956 and
        live in India, becoming a naturalised Indian citizen. His major works include Daedalus (1924), Animal Biology
        (with British evolutionist Julian Huxley, 1927), The Inequality of Man (1932), The Causes of Evolution (1932).
        The Marxist Philosophy and the Sciences (1938), Keeping Cool and Other Essays (1940), Science Advances (1947),
        and The Biochemistry of Genetics (1954).<br><br>

        The essay 'What I Require from Life' (1940), first published in The Daily Worker, reflects socialistic
        convictions demanding democratic activities in work places. This essay is written in simple and lucid language.

    <h3>a. How does the writer distinguish between a peaceful age and a heroic age?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to J. B. S. Haldane, one can look forward to the life of peace in the

        peaceful age. In heroic age, on the other hand, the writer feels the lack of peace and

        quict.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Why does the writer want more freedom of speech than most people?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The writer wants more freedom of speech than most people because he enjoys a good deal of
        freedom. Moreover, he wants to write about anything he wishes to. He desires to aware us about false reality of
        the ruler and raise voice against their sophisticated life; however, the law of libel prevents him from doing
        so.</p>
    <h3>c. According to the writer, what are the four general human needs?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to the writer, the four general human needs are interesting and productive work,
        freedom, good health, and friendship.</p>
    <h3>d. What is the difference between desire and demand according to the writer?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to the writer, demand refers to the basic needs, such as health, employment,
        freedom and right to choose work and liberty as well as happiness. On the other hand, desire means wanting more
        than basic needs, such as, a room with books, a motorcar, a pleasant garden, and a bathing pool.</p>
    <h3>e. Why does the writer demand security?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Haldane demands security since peace and security are rightful aim of life. Violent
        adventure is merely an adaptation to the age in which he lives. All the worse things occur by the violent
        culture. He wants to feel ownership. He wants freedom within his territory. Moreover, he wishes to spend joyful
        life in liberty because this is the ending era of fascism.</p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>Explain the following lines with reference to the context:</h3>
    <p><strong>a. "The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>This line has been taken out from a modern western essay entitled "What I Require from
        Life", by a British-Indian scientist and writer, J.B.S. Haldane. The essayist is always in favour of life,
        liberty, and happiness. He has some basic demands in life, including health, security, liberty and happiness. He
        raises voice against fascism and tyranny. He is demanding democratic activities in his life.<br><br>

        In this very line, he describes about adventurous life. It is impossible to understand the meaning of life
        without understanding series of adventures. The writer regards an adventure as a demand of life rather than just
        a thrill. All of us are supposed to be explorers, and treasure hunters of the soul. We are not supposed to be
        sleep walking through the world. We can't be confined to the tyrannical rules. This is the world of dramatic
        arena, and each of our lives is supposed to go ahead in the best possible way. We want democratic activities. We
        must have to right to think critically and reasoning truth. We have to get all essential things what we demand.
        We must have to get chance to quest about doubting things with moral values.
    </p>
    <p><strong>b. "I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their own and
            their friends' well-being."</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>The above given extract is taken out from a modern western essay entitled "What I Require
        from Life", by a British-Indian scientist and writer, J.B.S. Haldane. Here, the writer focuses on the democratic
        activities in work place.<br><br>

        According to the writer, the workers should be paid according to their work, not according to the rules of the
        company. They have to see the fruit of their own work. Their friends also should be in well-being. Here, the
        author somehow talks about socialism. First, the factory owner should satisfy their workers. Due to the
        efficient workers, the industrialists get benefits. The author doesn't like the exploitation of labourers. He
        seeks the right of human beings through in these lines.<br><br> Only workers work is prioritized. Their benefits
        of and liberty within the work are ignored. By presenting inhuman treatment of the labourers in a factory. J. B.
        S. Holden brings the socialistic motive here: he demands for democracy because the depressive time of fascism
        ends in the democratic era.
    </p>
    <p><strong>c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>J.B.S. Haldane has taken reference from the two well-noted ancient philosophers: Aristotle
        and Socrates. Firstly, he uses the Aristotelian definition of happiness while talking about pleasing job.
        Similarly, he makes reference to Socrates suicidal death while elaborating his own requirement of death from
        life. I think, the writer has used these allusions to make his credibility of delivery strong To say in another
        word, he wants to appeal to the readers by showing that the notable philosophers also share his concern.</p>
    <p><strong>d. Discuss the essay in terms of its language, purpose, subject, point of view and mode of
            writing.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>"What I Require from Life" is a modern western essay by a British Indian scientist and
        writer, J.B.S. Haldane, This essay s written in simple and lucid language with substantial references and
        examples. The writer aims to take a glimpse of freedom based life in the age of war and terror. He further
        advocates for democratic activities in work places. He has applied first-person point of view. Besides, hel
        implies subjective or personal mode of writing while discussing his requirements to be happy and satisfied in
        his life.</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>J.B.S. Haldane in his essay "What I Require from Life" delivers on his

        requirements to be happy and satisfied in his life. I also follow some of his principles. I require freedom,
        good health, interesting work and positive companionship to be happy and satisfied.
    </p>
    <h3>b. What is socialism? How is it different from capitalism?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Simply speaking, socialism is a political and an economic system. It covers a range of
        economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production. Moreover, it upholds
        collectivism. In a state of socialism, there is no privately owned property. In it the production of goods and
        services is either partially or fully regulated by the government. Cuba is an example of a socialist nation. Its
        economy is state-run, and it lacks a stock exchange. Healthcare and education are all completely managed and
        administered by the government.<br><br>
        Capitalism, on the other hand, is a political and an economic system based on the private ownership of the means
        of production and their operation for profit. Furthermore, the capitalist economic model relies on free market
        conditions for the creation of wealth; the production of goods and services is based on supply and demand in the
        general market. In capitalism, owners control the factors of production and derive their income from it, not the
        state. Hong Kong and Singapore are capitalist nations.
    </p>
    <h3>c. Write an essay about your dream house. </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: Dream House<br></strong>Everyone has an idea of what kind of house they need in when they grow up.
        Some prefer large mansions in big towns, while others wish to own smaller houses in the isolated islands. I
        belong to the second group. I hold the belief that it is not how big the house is, it is how happy we are in
        it.<br><br>I am a nature lover. I want a small beautiful house in the countryside, where I can feel closer to
        nature. I admire the place surrounded by trees. Environment filled with trees will ensure I have clean air,
        peace and happiness. Listening to the bird's song is what I love as that gives me joy and leaves me refreshed
        and encouraged A small garden with flowers, vegetables and fruits is a must. It should have a large compound for
        playing and rearing animals. A farm is an added advantage as I love farming. The house should be near a mall,
        school and church for shopping, education and my spirituality respectively.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 4 - What is Poverty ?</h1>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-
        Jo Goodwin Parker</p>
    <h2>Before Reading</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer these questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. What do you consider poverty to be? Do you have a definitive explanation of it or do you consider it an
        abstract circumstance?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong> In my opinion, poverty is the condition of being unable to fulfill our basic needs because
        of the lack of resources. It usually signifies deprivation of economic

        resources.
    </p>
    <h3>b. Look at this picture. What do you see? Where do you see such people? Who are the poor? Why are they poor?
        Where do the poor usually live?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In this picture, we can see a helpless poor mother, with her little baby, asking for alms.
        We can see such people, especially in the streets and the temples. The people having inadequate economic
        resources to meet their daily needs are poor. They poor because of various factors, like caste discrimination,
        lack of employment opportunities, illiteracy, and physical disabilities. Poor people usually live in the open
        streets, resting places or religious places.</p>
    <p>Jo Goodwin Parker was an anonymous person from West Virginia, the Southern United

        States. Parker

        mailed her essay to George Henderson, preferring that the editor present no byline.

        George Henderson, a professor at the University of Oklahoma, received it while he was writing his 1971 book,

        It was signed "Jo Goodwin Parker". No further information was ever discovered about the essay or its source.
        Whether the author of this essay was in reality a woman describing her own painful experiences or a sympathetic
        writer who had adopted her persona, Jo Goodwin Parker remains a mystery. So in keeping with the spirit of its
        initial publication, Parker's essay is kept here without any biographical data about its author.<br><br>

        Jo Goodwin Parker's essay 'What is Poverty? is about Parker who has personally experienced rural poverty. She
        explains her story from childhood to adulthood. Her struggles are overwhelming. Using examples drawn from
        personal experience, she explains the meaning of poverty in this essay. Her use of commotative language creates
        many harsh images of her experiences in a life of poverty illustrating the difficulties and challenges her
        impoverished family experiences. The essay is a personal account, addressed directly to the reader, about living
        in poverty.

    <h2>Understanding the text </h2>
    <h3>a. What is poverty according to Parker?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In her essay, "What is Poverty", American essayist Jo Goodwin Parker forwards a
        comprehensive definition of poverty. According to her, poverty is bad smell, dirt, tiredness, ugliness, cruelty,
        sleeplessness, begging, black future, and nightmare. Moreover, she defines it as a lack of-respect, hope, better
        foods, medicinal care, proper sanitation and proper education. It is like an acid that destroys pride, honour.
        health and future.</p>
    <h3>b. How is poverty difficult for Parker's children? List some specific examples.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Food, shelter and clothes are the main obstacles Parker faces in simply trying to keep her
        three children clean and fed which are the essential basic human needs. On account of insufficient financial
        resources, she and her family have to live very unhappy life. As she has to spend most of her time earning
        wages, her children are not properly looked after. The poor babies have to do with cornbread without eggs. and
        oleo. She even does not have a material to attend her children with runny noses. They don't have extra books, no
        magazines, no extra pencils, or crayons, or paper and most important of all, they do not have health. They have
        worms and infections. They do not sleep well on the floor. Similarly, other children don't play with them.</p>
    <h3>c. How does Parker try to obtain help, and what problems does she encounter?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Parker tries to get help from her relatives and others. She pays visit to different. people
        in different places but nobody offers her loan. She is told to wait. Accordingly, waiting is painful. However,
        no matter how long she waits, she is sent home without any reward.</p>
    <h3>d. Why are people's opinions and prejudices her greatest obstacles?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to Parker, the upper and middle classes cannot understand her situation. Instead
        of helping, they go on complaining about the government spending money on the immoral mothers of illegitimate
        children. That means, neither they provide her financial aid nor peace. Their criticism gets on her nerves. They
        offer her invalid solutions, Finally, she kindly requests them to be silent.</p>
    <h3>e. How does Parker defend her inability to get help? How does she discount the usual solutions society has for
        poverty (e.g., welfare, education, and health clinics)?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Parker declares that she is not able to obtain the aids that are on offer. Accordingly, the
        government's help package (seventy-eight dollars a month) is too slim. Schools. provide free education but they
        don't pay for stationery. They have got lunch programs too, but her infants are so fragile that they won't be
        able to make it to school at all. Likewise, health clinics are far off in the towns; she can't afford to take
        her children there.</p>
    <h2>Reference to the context</h2>
    <h3>a. Explain the following:</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: Poverty is looking into a black future.</strong>The above given line is extracted from a modern
        western essay entitled "What is Poverty?", by an American essayist, Jo Goodwin Parker. Using examples drawn from
        her own person experience, the author explains the meaning of poverty in this essay. In this extract, she
        focuses on a particular aspect of poverty.<br><br>
        With the view of her current situation, Parker sees a dark future for her children.

        Accordingly, they will not find good friends, thanks to their inborn curse of

        poverty. Instead, they will join the gang of thieves. She imagines them behind the

        bars of their prison. They will start using drug or alcohol to forget the pain of

        enslavement and unemployment. She expresses bitterness at the thought of her

        daughter leading a hellish life, like hers.
    </p>
    <h3>b. What does Parker mean by "The poor are always silent"?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>According to Parker, the poor people are always silent. They have no voice because it is
        suppressed by the upper and middle classes. Moreover, others don't like the poor raising a voice. Instead of
        kindness and sympathy, they come up with anger. The writer is a bit ironical in this statement. She means to say
        that the voice of the poor has no meaning at all since it won't be heard or addressed by the listeners.</p>
    <h3>c. What writing strategy does the author use at the beginning of most of the paragraphs? Do you notice a
        recurring pattern? What is it? </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Parker begins most of her paragraphs with "Poverty is". To be specific, 8 paragraphs of the
        present essay commence with the same phrase. Another recurring pattern is "But you say to me", which is used
        twice consecutively.</p>
    <h3>d. How does Parker develop each paragraph? What details make each paragraph memorable?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Parker develops each paragraph with a clear topic sentence. Later, she presents the details
        that support the respective topic sentences. Explicit graphic details,

        emphasized by personal appeal, make each paragraph memorable.
    </p>
    <h3>e. In the final paragraph, how does the author use questions to involve the reader

        in the issue of poverty?
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In the final paragraph, Parker asks a very weighty question to the readers: "Can you be
        silent too? The writer seems depressed with the torturous words of her! privileged audience. She indicates that
        her addressees are not much concerned about the plight of the poor. She does not entertain actionless words.</p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. Define a social problem (homelessness, unemployment, racism) imitating

        Parker's style.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: Homelessness<br></strong>You ask me what is homelessness? Listen to me. Here I am, dirty, smelly,
        and with no "proper" cloth on and with the stench of my rotting teeth near you. I will tell you. Listen to me.
        Listen without pity. I cannot use your pity. Listen with understanding. Put yourself in my dirty, worn out,
        ill-fitting shoes, and hear me. Homelessness is getting up every morning on the lane of a cold street. It is
        being chased away from the temples and parking garages. It is a shame. It is wandering hungrily for hours. It is
        an aimless drifting. It is inability to win the onlookers' sympathy and favour. It is playing hide and seek with
        the dogs every single day</p>
    <h3>b. Using adjectives to highlight the futility of the situation, write a short

        definition essay on Growing up in Poverty.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: Growing up in Poverty<br></strong>Poverty is the world at its worst. One does not entertain being
        deprived of basic needs on the daily basis. Growing up in poverty is dying many times while still

        breathing.<br><br>

        Poverty or the inability to meet even the basic necessities of life aims to erode the very right of a person to
        live life with dignity. Where basic needs like the next meal, a shelter over one's head, clothes to provide
        cover are t met, being able to provide for education, recreation or medical facility is unheard of.<br><br>

        It is not hard to imagine how this life of hopelessness would affect the weak young minds, bodies and hearts.
        Being exposed to such aterial deprivation increases the chances of undergoing abuse of all kinds from a tender
        age. Child labour, child exploitation, street violence, domestic ill-treatment, bullying, sexual abuse are the
        cruel receptions they face from their early years. No wonder then violence becomes a norm in their way of life
        and it is a constant struggle to either fight back or give up in such an environment.

    <h2>Before Reading</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer these questions.</strong></p>
    <h3>a. What is science? What do the scientists do?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Science can be defined as a field of knowledge. It is a way of learning about the natural
        world. Scientists use observation, logical reasoning and practical experimentation to extract knowledge.
        Moreover, they ask questions, make

        predictions, test their guesses and bring out their findings.
    </p>
    <h3>b. We are all scientists. The nature of science can be captured to our ordinary

        experiences. Share your scientific experiences that you have got in your

        everyday life.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>All of us are scientists in some ways. We encounter scientific experiences in our daily
        life. I ask so many questions to myself, like what sort of life is present in other planets? how is the Black
        Hole? And can animals think like us? Hundreds of curiosities run along my head. Most of them go unanswered. I
        love to observe different aspects of nature too.</p>
    <h3>c. Work in pairs and then complete the following table.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>

    <h3>c. Are the following statements true? Why or why not? Discuss with your

        partner.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>i. Money is more powerful than intellectual resources.</strong></p>

        token of humankind's survival. He further justifies his claim by stating that the scientists are capable of
        ensuring mankind's safe future with their tools. In this regard. he maintains that the scientific research has
        an undeniable place in the modern world.
    </p>
    <h3>e. What can be the purpose of the essayist of using quotations in the essay?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Keilis-Borok argues in favour of scientific research in his essay. His use of

        people in the world.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In the essay 'Scientific Research is a Token of Humankind's Survival', Keilis Borok says
        about his profession as a scientist, and views that science is the humankinds indispensable guardian and
        caretaker. He regards his profession as a highly practical and impactful job. He thinks that science is a hope
        of survival and well-being of all the human beings. Accordingly, only scientists can think impartially and
        practically. They are always committed in bringing out practical measures to basically all sorts of problems.
    </p>
    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>
    <h3>a. Everyone lives under the fear of annihilation by nuclear weapons. Explain this statement.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>Fear of total human annihilation is a tough feeling to live with every day. Bombs can
        damage life and property instantly. They give life-long psychological traumas in addition to physical, social
        and economic ruins. We cannot live peacefully with the overwhelming fear of nuclear weapons possessed by the
        developed nations.</p>
    <h3>b. The essayist says "While there is science, there is hope of survival and

        wellbeing for all of us.' Explain it.
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: </strong>In the essay 'Scientific Research is a Token of Humankind's Survival, Keilis Borok says
        about his profession as a scientist, and views that science is the humankinds indispensable guardian and
        caretaker. The essayist argues that science is a hope of survival and well-being of all the human beings. As far
        as his view is concerned the scientists are capable of ensuring mankind's safe future with their tools.
        Moreover, he highlights that only scientists can think impartially and practically. His statement directs us
        toward the fact that they are always committed in bringing out practical measures to basically all sorts of
        problems.</p>
    <h3>c. Is science a blessing or a curse? Write an essay on it.</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans: Science blessing or curse?<br></strong>This is the age of science and technology. To be honest,
        science has revolutionized the human existence. It has made man's life more comfortable, more secure and more
        powerful. Having said that, one cannot ignore the flip side of the present ruler of modern world.<br><br>Science
        can be called one of the greatest blessings of this age. We owe all our progress to it. Today we can go round
        the globe in a matter of hours. Inventions such as washing machine, refrigerator, air-conditioner, dishwasher
        and geyser make our lives easy. Television, cinema and compact discs have changed the entertainment industry.
        Thousands of lives are saved every day due to the progress of medical science. It is impossible to run a company
        or a factory without a computer. We can also say that computers are the greatest invention of modern age.
        However, r science has also brought a lot of misery upon man. Nuclear weapons can destroy our planet several
        times over. Likewise, it has also relieved to a great extent human suffering. Advance in the field of medicine
        and surgery have reduced the rate of infant mortality. The average life span of man has increased. Many the
        dreaded diseases like cholera, small-pox and even tuberculosis are easily curable with the help of
        medicines.<br><br>But there is a negative face of science too. If biotechnology is a great boon for fighting
        disease, lethal biological weapons and germs are the killers of a large number of species. Nuclear weapons have
        caused immeasurable loss of life and property. There have been many scientific researches and discoveries which
        have unfortunately been hijacked to harmful destructive paths. The misuse of science has ushered in our life
        many undesirable elements. Other disciplines, like religion, morality and philosophy, are portrayed negatively
        in the presence of science. Needless to say, machines have also led to degradation of our environment. The
        poisonous fumes and gases emitted by vehicles and industrial units have polluted the air we breathe and pose a
        threat to the health of the people.<br><br>In conclusion, we can say that by science itself, we cannot call it
        blessing or curse, It is upon the users to give science positive or dark look.

   Chapter 1 <br>

    Trifles
    </h1>
    <p>Susan Glaspell</p>

<h2>Before Reading</h2>
<h2>Answer these questions.</h2>
<h3>a.In what ways do societal norms affect you?</h3>
<p>Ans. In simple words, societal norms the unwritten rules of beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that are considered acceptable in a particular social group or culture. They represent individuals' basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do. They also dictate us on how to behave properly in the society. In this regard, they serve as the guidelines to discipline ourselves.</p>

<h3>b. Are women dominated by men in your society? </h3>
<p>I live in a patriarchal society. Here, women are regarded inferior to men. As a result, the formers are the subjects to discrimination in my society. </p>
<h3>Are there differences between men and women in how they think, act, communicate, behave and relate to others? </h3>
<p>In our society, men and women are raised differently. In the process, men are taught more work-related skills whereas women possess more nurturing. personalities. Since their upbringing is different, there are differences between men and women in how they think, act, communicate, behave and relate to others.</p>

<h2>Understanding the text</h2>
<h3>Answer the following questions.</h3>
<h3>a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain. </h3>
<p>I believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband. Many evidences from the text support my stance. The dead bird and the dirty appearance of kitchen refer to the fact that the accused was undergoing series of domestic violence. The bird had its neck wrung. To avenge the same, she murdered the tormentor in the similar fashion.</p>

<h3>b. Do you think Mr. Wright's death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' home?</h3>

<p>I think Mr. Wright's death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' home. Perhaps Mrs. Wright would not have notified the police about the murder: If she would, the same could have been done earlier.</p>

<h3>c.  Why does Mrs. Hale think that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence? </h3>
<p>Mrs. Hale displays her loyalty to Minnie Wright. She thinks that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence because accordingly, women are used to be concerned about the trifles or the things of little values. The preserve also refers to the pressure the society has imposed upon women.</p>
<h3>d. How does Mrs. Peters' homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright? </h3>
<p>Mrs. Peters is more aware of the responsibilities the women have to the law and to their husbands. Evidently, she also suffers the fate of Mrs. Wright at the hand of patriarchy. In this regard, she empathizes Mrs. Wright. She remembers a kitten she had as a a young girl, and that a boy took a hatchet to it before her eyes. She says she would have hurt him if she could. At the end of the play, she combines with Mrs. Hale to hide the most explicit evidence, the dead canary.</p>
<h3>e.How do the women's perspectives on men differ? </h3>
<p>Men think that women's lives are superficial Accordingly, their counterparts are interested only in silly matters. Their prejudice cost them the most substantial evidence- the dead bird. Mrs. Peters says that if the men heard them getting worried by seeing a dead canary, they would laugh. The women detectives are shown to be more sympathetic to the murderer.</p>

<h2>Reference to the context</h2>
<h3>Read the extracts from the play given below and answer the questions that follow.</h3>
<h3>a."MRS. PETERS:(glancing around). Seems funny to think of a bird here. But she must have had one, or why would she have a cage? I wonder what happened to it?</h3>
<strong>MRS. HALE: I s'pose maybe the cat got it."</strong>
<pre>
i. Who does 'she refer to?
Ans. 'She' refers to Minnie Wright.
ii. What does the word 'one' stand for?
Ans. "One' stands for 'a bird'.
iii. What is the full form of "s'pose"?
Ans. The full form of "s'pose" is suppose".
iv. What do you mean when Mrs. Hale says, "the cat got it"?
Ans. She means that the cat had killed the bird. 
    
</pre>

<h3>b. "MRS. HALE: Wright was close....... she used to wear pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster, one of the town girls singing in the choir.But that oh, that was thirty years ago." </h3>
<h3>i. Why does Mrs. Hale refer to Mrs. Hale refers to Mrs. Wright as "Minnie Foster"?</h3>
<p>Ans. Mrs Hale refers to Mrs. Wright tells to show the contrast between the character of her discussion before and after the marriage.</p>

<h3>ii. What does her description tell you about Mrs. Wright? </h3>
<p>Her description about Mrs. Wright tells us that she was freer and happier before getting married to Mr. Wright.</p>

<h3>iii. What does Mrs. Hale mean by "that was thirty years ago"?</h3>
<p>She means that was thirty years before the murder. </p>
<h3>c. What is the main theme of the play?</h3>
<p>The main theme of the play is social oppression of women or male's prejudice
    towards female.
    </p>

<h3>d. Discuss the symbolism used in the play.</h3>
<p>Susan Glaspell has used some symbols in her play. "Canning jars of fruit' stands for Minnie's extreme concern over her role as wife and her household responsibilities. "The dirty towel represents Mrs. Wright's poor housekeeping. Similarly, "the quilt refers to female space or concern. The most important symbol of all is the dead. songbird. This symbolizes Mr. Wright's abuse of his wife. Here, bird stands for Mrs. Wright's freedom. "Cage' represents John Wright's oppression of his wife and her spirit. Lastly, 'rope' refers to the women's means of seeking privilege or fighting back their imprisonment.</p>


<h3>e.. Discuss the setting of the play. Does it have an impact on the theme of the play?  </h3>
<p>The house of Mr. and Mrs. Wright is the place setting of the play. It is the spot, where Mr. Wright was murdered. The theme of the play is injustice towards women. I think no other setting could have been better to reflect on the ascribed
    theme.
    </p>

    <h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>

<h3>a. The credibility of a character is determined not only by the character's. thoughts and actions but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. Discuss in relation to the characters of Trifles.</h3>

<p>"Trifles' (1916) is a one-act play by an American playwright, novelist and writer, Susan Glaspell. The text centres on a mysterious murder at the Wright house. The play opens with Sheriff Henry Peters and county attorney George Henderson visiting the murder scene to investigate the murder of John Wright. His wife, Minnie Wright, has been arrested for the murder, and the two men have come to collect evidence against her. To that end, they have brought Lewis Hale, Minnie Wright's neighbor, who was the first person other than Minnie to see John's dead body. Hale will be a witness for the prosecution at the trial. With the three men are
    Mrs. Peters, the sheriff's wife, and Mrs. Hale, Lewis's wife, who have come to collect some of Minnie's personal effects to bring to her in prison. The sheriff is the first to enter the Wrights' little farmhouse. He and the other two men gather around the hot stove for warmth while the women linger in the doorway. It is clear that the two women are more upset about the murder than their husbands and that they have reservations about entering the house.
    </p>

<p>Inside, the men begin their investigation. Henderson questions Hale about the events of the previous day. Hale recounts how he was going to town with a sack of potatoes when he stopped at the Wright farm, wondering if the Wrights would like to share a telephone line. He found Minnie in her rocking chair behaving strangely. She told him that John was upstairs, dead, with a rope around his neck. At the time, Minnie claimed that John was strangled in his sleep by an unknown assailant and said she did not hear the strangling, because she "sleeps sound." Minnie was arrested and is now awaiting trial for the murder of her husband. She has been in jail for a full day at this point and needs a fresh change of clothes, which is why Mrs: Peters and Mrs. Hale have come out of kindness.</p>

<P>Henderson suggests that the men have a look around, thinking they might find some clues. The men decide not to search the room where Lewis Hale found Minnie, because, according to Sheriff Peters, there is "nothing here but kitchen things." These words demonstrate the sheriff's disdain for women's work, introducing the theme of sexism that recurs throughout the play. Sheriff Peters decides they are going to focus on the bedroom and the barn, where, they assume, the real clues will be found. When Henderson searches a cupboard, he finds several broken jars of preserves. He dismisses these jars as trifles," even though Minnie specifically mentioned the preserves, fearing that the jars would break in the freeze. While the men are upstairs, the women conduct the real investigation. As soon as they are alone, they begin gathering things to bring to Minnie in prison: a change of clothes, a shawl, a pleated apron. This leads them to some important discoveries.</P>


<p>First, the women note how dull and shabby Minnie's clothes are. Mrs. Hale says, "She used to wear pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster," meaning that marrying John changed her. Wright was an abusive, hot-tempered i man and forced Minnie to wear boring house clothes instead of the pretty clothes. she likes. This is the first indication that Minnie was unhappy with her controlling husband. Then there are the little things: the bread left out to get stale, the table only half-cleaned, a quilt with crooked, erratic stitching that reflects Minnie's mental state. Things were going downhill, the women realize, long before the murder. Their suspicions are confirmed when they find the final, most important clues: a broken birdcage and a dead eanary. It is likely that John broke this. birdcage, though it is unclear exactly why, beyond his general cruelty. Minnie has. been keeping the canary in a sewing box, wrapped up in silk like a treasure. This bird is symbolic of Minnie herself, who used to sing in the town's choir before she married.</p>

<p>When the men reappear suddenly, Mrs. Hale instinctively hides the sewing box and makes up a lie about a cat attacking the canary to explain away the presence of the birdcage. Before they leave, the men decide to take one last look upstairs. This gives the women time to discuss what to do. Both of them have come to sympathize with Minnie, understanding why she murdered her abusive husband Mrs Peters remembers what it was like when she lived on a farm with her husband. Life was rough then, and she lost her baby on the homestead. She isn't surprised that Minnie felt pushed beyond her limits. Together, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale decide to hide the evidence they have found as to Minnie's motive. Unsurprisingly, the men take no notice, thinking of these items as mere "trifles."</p>

<p>The above discussion has summarized the overall thought-processes of the characters of Glaspell's play. It stands to reason that the credibility of a character is determined not only by the character's thoughts and actions but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. </p>

<h3>b.Dramatic irony occurs when the reader or audience has information that is unknown to the characters in a play; it creates tension and suspense. Analyse the play discussing the author's use of dramatic irony based on these questions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What information is crucial to the play Trifles?</li>
    <li>How does the playwright use this information to create dramatic irony?</li>
    <li>What effect does the dramatic irony have on the audience and on the play?</li>
    </ul>
<p>Ans. The dramatic irony in "Trifles" builds as the women, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, find the clues about life in the Wright household. They discover the dead canary and note that someone appears to have broken its neck. The women know how much Mrs. Wright loved the bird, so they and the audience should make the assumption that Mr. Wright killed it. This deduction together with the other evidence of Mrs. Wright's growing instability (like the terrible sewing) lead the women and audience to believe in Mrs. Wright's guilt and the reason she killed her husband. This situation represents dramatic irony because the sheriff and county, attorney remain oblivious to these clues, so the audience knows more than they do about the crime.</p>

<h2>Before Reading</h2>
<h2>Answer these questions.</h2>
<h3>a. Have you ever had an unexpected meeting with someone in a park? </h3>
<p>Ans. I have had such an experience. Three years before I accidentally encountered my English teacher in the UN Park. He was there with his wife and children. 1 blushed at the sight of him.</p>

<h3>b. How do your expectations influence the way you interact with others? </h3>

<p>All of us have got expectations. They are the part of our disposition. A positive expectation marks a superior personality. Our expectations influence everything. including interaction with others. If we are going to get benefitted from the person we are communicating, we are likely to be more cordial and diplomatic.</p>

<h3>c.How have unexpected encounters in your life sometimes turned out to be rewarding?  </h3>
<p>Unexpected encounters can be rewarding sometimes. Once I came across a girl from my previous class in a park. We rarely conversed at school. We had a grand conversation on that day. We have become very good friends since then.</p>

<h3>h. Discuss how the play is built around humour and irony. </h3>

<p>Ans. A Sunny Morning' is a humorous one-act play by two Spanish playwrights, Serafin and Joaquin Alvarez Quintero. The writing duos retell a romantic tale, utilizing humour and irony as the chief literary devices. We can trace the element of humour from the beginning of the play. The little quarrels between the two elders set the comic tone of the play. The comic sense of Laura is admirable. ciders set up when she quips at Gonzalo's walking. "A carriage would not raise more dust than his feet." Her words create such ringing laughter that they are delectable. When she asks him, "Do you use your handkerchief as a shoe brush?" adds to the perfect m. Do you timing of comedy. </p>
<p>When it comes to irony, we can catch some deliberate efforts of the characters to
    hide or misinterpret truth. It is ironical that they do not want to disclose their
    identities, for they fear that their unpleasantly changed looks could be deterrents in their newly found joy.
    </p>

<h3>i. How is the title 'A Sunny Morning' justifiable? Discuss.</h3>
<p>"A Sunny Morning' is a one-act play by two Spanish playwrights, Serafin and Joaquin Alvarez Quintero. Set in a park in Madrid on a sunny autumn morning, the play narrates the reunion of two lovers, Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo, now in their
    70s meeting at a park who in their youth were passionate lovers but torn apart by
    the cruelty of fate.
    </p>

<p>The title of the play coheres the theme of the text. Simply keeping, the drama comes with youthful romance of the lead characters' past and romantic aspects of love in the guise of new friendship. Moreover, their relation has started shining. They are as bright and colourful as the rays of sunlight. Since the playwrights intend to serve a perfect romantic reunion of the old lovers, the title does justice in

<h3>a. What do you predict will happen in the next meeting between Dona Laura and
    Don Gonzalo? Discuss. 
    </h3>

<p>The playwrights have ended the play with a positive note. We can expect more frequent friendly meetings between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo from this setup. </p>

<h3>b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets affect future meetings?</h3>

<p>I think, it was wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret. They are enjoying talking to each other as the strangers. If the identity was revealed, they might have got surprised and embarrassed. Moreover, their reunion could have become tragic as well. Their secrets might hurt them in long run. Their future meetings might turn into more tragic gradually.</p>

<h3>c. Write the summary of the play.</h3>
<p>"A Sunny Morning' is a one-act play by two Spanish playwrights, Serafin and Joaquin Alvarez Quintero. Set in a park in Madrid on a sunny autumn moming, the play narrates the reunion of two lovers, Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo, now in their 70s meeting at a park who in their youth were passionate lovers but torn apart bythe cruelty of fate.</p>

<p>The drama begins with Dona Laura, a beautiful white-haired lady of about seventy, happily feeding pigeons in the park. Don Gonzalo, a gentleman of seventy, gouty and impatient, enters and, finding his favourite park bench occupied by the three priests, sits beside his lover from the past. Both of them visit the park regularly. being accompanied by their servants because of their old age. They are annoyed with each other as both want bench to themselves. Gonzalo rudely comments on as want her feeding the pigeons and starts reading his poems loudly. After asking her permission while reading from the poet Campo amor’s Twenty years pass, both feel that they were the lovers in the past. He tells her that he first met him in Valencia, a city in Spain, which also happens to be his native place. Surprisingly, Laura also tells him she had also Spent her youth at a villa called Maricela, not far from Valencia. Gonzalo who was also familiar with the villa asks if she a remembers a beautiful lady called Laura. She lies to him that the girl was her best friend. They talk about love-affair between the friend and a gallant lover. Gonzalo tells her that the follow was his cousin. When the girl was to be married off to a merchant, the lover duels with him, in the process wounding him badly, and runs off to Madrid. She waits for her lover to return but when he does not, marries the merchant after two years. Gonzalo tells her that his cousin joined the army and met with glorious death. Both realise that they are lying but pretend to be unaware. At the end of the play, both Laura and Gonzalo do not acknowledge who they really are and leave the park promising to meet the next day.</p>
<p>In this way, the playwright duos bring not only a comical side of a romantic
    relationship but also let us feel the pain of tragic separation.

<h1>Chapter 3
    <br>
    Refund
</h1>

<P>Fritz Karinthy</P>
<h2>Before Reading</h2>

<h3>Answer these questions.</h3>
<h3>a. Will you demand your tuition fees back from the school if you don't get any job in the future?</h3>
<p>Ans. No, I will not demand my tuition fees back from the school if you don't get any job in the future.</p>

<h3>b. What do you want to be after getting education?</h3>
<p>Ans. I want to get a job suiting my qualification after getting education.</p>


<h3>c. Does one's certificate show the talent of that person?</h3>
<p>A certificate does not necessarily show the talent of a person. It is just a piece of paper. It can't decide a person's true character or personality. A talent, on the other hand, is an untaught quality of a person. Not all certified people are talented and not all talented people are certified. A talent is more important than a certificate in the present world.</p>

<p><strong>Fritz Karinthy</strong> (1887-1938) was a Hungarian satirical writer. He excelled as a novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist and playwright. Deeply interested in natural sciences, he studied to be a teacher, but became a journalist and joined the literary periodical Nyugat Strongly philosophical and humanistic in his outlook, he raised his powerful voice against the barbarism and horrors of World War I. His works such as That's How You Write (1912), Journey around My Skull (1939), Please Sir
    (1916) and Professor won him a lot of recognition.
    </p>

<p>The play Refund written in 1938 is about a man about forty who goes back to the school in which he had studied and demands a refund of the fees he had paid eighteen years back claiming that he had learnt nothing useful at school and he is now goodfor- nothing. This play was adopted by the American playwright Percival Wilde for a general audience. Refund brings out the extraordinary sense of parody, word play in Karinthy's literary art. The play is full of humour which deals with an extraordinarily absurd situation.</p>


<h2>Understanding the text</h2>
<h3>Answer the following questions.</h3>
<h3>a. Why does Wasserkopf demand a refund of his tuition fees from the school? </h3>
<p>Ans. Wasserkopf demands a refund of his tuition fees from the school as he had learnt
    nothing useful at school and he is now good-for-nothing. He claims that he was not taught and trained properly. In this regard, he feels that his education is worthless.
    </p>

    <h3>b. Why does Wasserkopf consider himself good for nothing?</h3>

<P>Ans. Wasserkopf considers himself good for nothing because he could not get any employment. The people told him that he was not suitable for anything wherever he went for job. He blames his alma mater for his unemployment and financial bankruptcy.</P>

<h3>c. What did the teachers decide to do when Wasserkopf asked for a refund? </h3>

<p>After an urgent staff meeting, they decided to conduct a re-examination for
    Wasserkopf. Accordingly, the said re-evaluation will dismiss the ex-pupil's claim that he has not received any knowledge from their institution
    </p>

<h3>d. Why did Wasserkopf give ridiculous answers? Why did the teachers accept?
    Why did the teacher accept these answers?
    </h3>

<p>Ans. Wasserkopf gave ridiculous answers as his intention was to fail thereby seeking a refund of his school tuition fees. The teachers wanted to ensure that the old pupil passed the re-examination. Firstly, they prepared simple questions. Then, they accepted the silly answers as they wanted to prove the challenger as an excellent student and help the principal out from the present complication.</p>

<h3>e. How does the Mathematics Master describe Wasserkopf's character?</h3>
<p>The Mathematics Master describes Wasserkopf as an extremely clever individual,
    who will try to get the better of the teachers and trick the school into refunding his
    fees by any means. 
    </p>

<h3>f. How did the teachers outwit Wasserkopf? </h3>

<p>After the Mathematics Master's briefing, all the teachers understood that
    Wasserkopf was intending on failing the re-examination. They decided that whatever answers he gave would be judged right. They asked him very easy questions and accepted all of his ridiculous answers. Towards the end of the test, the Mathematics Master asked the examinee to calculate the amount to be refunded by school. Wasserkopf's figure stood at 6,450 crowns. He was then told that the calculation was part of the test and outwitted on account of his sound mathematical genuineness.
    </p>


<h3>g. What is the final judgment on Waserkopf's demand of refund? </h3>
<p>Waserkopf's demand of refund is overruled as he succeeds in the re-examination
    conducted by his old school teachers.

</pre>

<h3>c. Explain the following line of the play:
    <br>
    "Because I didn't get my money's worth, that's why!"
</h3>
<p>
    The above given line is extracted from a modern western one-act play entitled "Refund by a Hungarian novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist and playwright, Fritz Karinthy. The author is well known for his satirical writing. The play "Refund' written in 1938 is about a man about forty who goes back to the school in which he had studied and demands a refund of the fees he had paid eighteen years back claiming that he had learnt nothing useful at school and he is now good-for
    nothing.
    </p>


<p>Wasserkopf addresses the above statement to the principal of the institution from where he has received his education. He speaks these words after the Principal demands explanation for the visitor's proposal of getting back his tuition fees. Accordingly, he did not receive proper education from his school. As a result, he could not get any employment. He thinks his claim is valid and demands a re re-examination to substantiate his demand.</p>


<h3>d. What is the theme of the play?</h3>
<p>The major theme of the play is failure of present-day education. The playwright satirizes modern education system, which fails to prepare productive and skilful graduates:</p>

<h3>e. Sketch the character of Wasserkopf.</h3>
<p>Wasserkopf is the male lead of Fritz Karinthy's one-act play Refund'. He is a forty-year-old man. He goes back to the school in which he had studied and demands a refund of the fees he paid eighteen back claiming that he had learnt nothing useful at school and he is now good-for-nothing. He is portrayed as a hopeless and sad man by the playwright. The unemployed broke blames his school for not preparing him well during his school life. He believes that his teachers have made him a failure. He presents himself very roughly and insolently in front of the staff of the school. His character is also a reflection of poor education system. His behaviours show that he has not leant anything about discipline while he was a student. He sounds clever to some extent. His Mathematics Master also regards him as a cunning student. However, his wit stands secondary to his teachers' as he is tricked into returning home empty-handed. The writer presents Wasserkopf as a stereotype to show the failure of modern-day education.</p>


<h2>Reference beyond the text</h2>

<h3>a. The play is a satire on the present-day education system. Do you think that our education system does not prepare students for life? Discuss.</h3>
<p>"Refund' is a modern western one-act play by a Hungarian novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist and playwright, Fritz Karinthy. The author is well-known for his satirical writing. The play "Refund written in 1938 is about a man about forty who goes back to the school in which he had studied and demands a refund of the fees he had paid cighteen years back claiming that he had learnt nothing useful at school and he is now good-for-nothing. Through the characterization of Wasserkopf, the author casts a satire on the present-day education system</p>

<p>I think our education system has some flaws. Firstly, it is theory-heavy. The students are not imparted with skill-based practical knowledge. As a result, a great of Nepalese students remain unemployed or under-employed. They even can't deal with other practical matters that they come across during the course of their life. Hence, I feel our education system does not prepare students for life.</p>

<h3>b. Our education system focuses on memorisation rather than creative thinking. Do you think the knowledge imparted by education may not have practical relevance in one's day-to-day life? Who do you blame for this?</h3>
<p>The purpose of an education system is to prepare skilled and thoughtful nation builders. These young school products should possess a sound set of problem solving and creative life skills. However, our education system prioritizes theory and memorization to practice and creativity. I don't think theory-heavy knowledge can meet the learners' requirement of their future orientation. Resultantly, they become the prey of unemployment and brain-drain respectively. I blame all the stakeholders (state, administrator, teacher and student) for this sort of failure.</p>


<h3>c. Most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. Do you think that certificate will help them in their future career?</h3>
<p>Most of the modern students follow rote-learning just to pass an exam. If one reads just for examination, s/he will miss out important knowledge required to deal with practical situations in the future. The present readers will need jobs to survive in their working age. Again, every job requires knowledge. In our context, a learner is encouraged to chase higher grades or marks. Certificates become the determinant of one's successful future. However, a certificate without knowledge is just like a well without water. As far as my view is concerned, schooling should be considered as a building block of one's future. In this regard, we must focus on knowledge full of life skills to address the learners' future employability.</p>
